But if George Mason is not in fact the best college for me, even though the person I asked was trying to help, that one opinion could sway me to go there anyway and not have the best experience. But yet if I go to ten people to advice, including the person who suggested George Mason, they might be the only one who would say that and maybe five of the other people I asked might say Virginia Tech, and I would decide to go to Virginia Tech instead of to George...   \n",

       "3      People are debating whether if drivers should or should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Some people think that using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should be allowed because they try multi-tasking and have important calls while some are addicted and can't stay off their phone. Other people says that you shouldn't be able to be on your cell phone while operating a vehicle because the cell phone can cause accidents while driving. I also think that you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle because it can cause vehicle collisions, slow reaction time, and fat...   \n",

This has to stop immediately, texting and driving puts people's lives at risk. This simple act has caused many fatalities over that last years. Fortunately, the government have put a new law to deal with this problem with our generations problem of texting and driving. I strongly feel that texting and driving is dangerous and should be prohibited.\\n\\nDiving more into detail, texting and driving is hazardous and life threatening.

Another reason is you could test every idea that you get.\\n\\nOne last reason is some of the people could agree with the other person.\\n\\nPeople try to ask a good amount of people just in case they hear more than one response from someone.\\n\\nThis is good to hear a lot of ideas and to see how many you get from the people you a...   \n",
       "15138  Do you ever want more opinions and options when it comes to advice? Well you can! You can simply ask more than one person for their opinion so you can choose yours! It is good to go to multiple sources for opinions, because it opens your mind up to new things, you can get good or bad feed back, and you can now see things from different points of views.\\n\\nSeeking for more opinions can open your mind up for new and different things.

Everyone needs help with something, and it is a genetic trait to ask someone else for advice. However, a lot of people can be dishonest, and in this day and age, that number only goes up. Because of this, sometimes, asking just one person is not enough. Now a days, a person looking for help will most likely confront multiple people for advice to prevent problems with misinformation.

But these leaders would almost never have only one adviser, but more often than not they would have several in order to make sure they were doing what was right.
