When his summer started,Generic_Name could clearly read what he is supposed to do for his project and he could get to it right away. He created one of his most enjoyable PowerPoints because it was easier for him to talk and write about, when it was teacher designed, the project was about explaining into depth why ones years in middle school are the hardest years of schooling, he took a lot of time trying to understand what the project really was and how it worked. Generic_Name could understand the project more since it was made by a student and it would be easier for a student to understand a student than a student trying to understand a teacher.

Generic_Name, a photography student, has a summer project on what their summer vacation is like in pictures for his photography class, this project was made by a student in his photography class. Generic_Name put more effort into it because it is something he found interesting and he had more of a reason to take pictures of even though years prior his teacher made projects about taking a photograph of an exotic animal and write a paper about it, he liked this idea for a project because he could just enjoy his summer vacation while also doing his summer project at the same time. Students find these summer projects more interesting and put more effort into it because they are made by other students in their classes.\\n\\nSummer projects that are student-designed would likely appeal to students making them more fun for the students learn during the project. A high school engineering class is given a summer project, they are asked to build a model rocket, which was a project idea created by a student. The class when they went on summer vacation, had more fun because they got to build something that was more interesting, appealing, and fun for them as students and as young engineers. These students also learned a lot about how rockets work and how the engineering process goes into them. An AP history class is given a summer project, which they are asked to create an alternate historical scenario in which something that happened in history, just did not occur or was altered a little bit, this project idea was created but a student in this AP history class. The students in this class during their summer spent time researching a specific event that they found interesting and tweaked it to their liking, this gave them the power to do whatever they want with history and they found it fun because they learned more about specific events in history and got to change them to completely different scenarios. Summer projects that are student-designed are more fun to the students in these classes because students in those specific class would know what other students would find fun and appeal toward them.\\n\\nStudent-designed summer projects are better for students than teacher-designed ones because they are more for fun for the student to make, they are easier to understand for the students because students learn more from other students, and they would put more effort into those projects because students know what other students in their grade like.

The summer projects designed by these students are usually easier to understand. GENERIC_NAME is a student of a middle school. He must do a summer project, which is the most difficult project about school and what is the PowerPoint created in his performance. Can clearly read what he should do for his project, and he can do it immediately. He created one of his most pleasant Powerpoints about why the middle school was the most difficult academic year for the years. He spent a lot of time trying to understand the true meaning and how to work in the project. GENERIC_NAME can understand the project more because it is made by students. Compared with students who try to understand the teacher, students understand that students are easy to understand. GENERIC_NAME is a 5th grade student with a summer project. In the next school year, entering the sixth grade, Generic_name must do a project in which middle school he has ever imagined him since he entered middle school. This is what he must consider. Researchers with grades will know what their age will understand and what they usually think of in him. Reasons for the effort and actual project. GENERIC_NAME is a student who wants to be a website designer and is asked to carry out summer projects in its IT class. The project is creating a poster of a person who wants to do for their career. This project is created by a student in his IT class. The student knows that the student does not like a theme project.When you arrive in summer, Generic_name is more motivated to complete his project because he can talk about his enthusiasm as the website design. GENERIC_NAME has made more efforts in his project, because it is created by a student, and they know that other students do not want to talk about a theme. GENERIC_NAME is a student of photography. There is a summer project that tells about their photography course of the heat. This project is produced by his photography class students. GENERIC_NAME has made more efforts in it, because it is an interesting thing that he has found, and he has more reasons to take pictures. Even if his teacher made a project about taking foreign animals and writing a paper on his teacher, He likes this project because he can enjoy his summer vacation while carrying out the summer project at the same time. Students have found that these summer projects are more interesting, and they have made more efforts for this, because they are designed by other ST -made summer projects that may attract students to learn more interesting students for students during the project. A high school engineering course is a summer project. They are required to build a model rocket, which is a project idea created by a student. When the class goes to the summer vacation, they will be more interesting because they must build some more interesting, attractive and fun things for students and young engineers. These students have also learned how to work in the Rockets and how to enter them. Given an AP history lesson, they were asked to create a alternative historical scene, which happened in history, but it did not happen or changed. The idea of ​​this project was created, but in this AP history class A student. In summer, students in this lesson spend time studying a specific activity. They discover interesting events and adjust them to their preferences, which makes them have the ability to do anything they want to do in history. They find that it is very good Interesting, because they understand more about specific events in history and change it to completely different scenarios. The students designed by students are more interesting to be more interesting these courses because these specific classes will know what fun and attracting them will be found. The design of the summer project is better than students, because they are more willing to create for students, making them easier to understand for students, because students learn more from other students, and they will pay more for these projects Work hard because students know other students in their grades. The summer project is a lot of work for students, but if the students allow these projects to be designed so that they can attract other children in the classroom, or their grades are more and more students will perform these summer projects and expand their KNO. They should learn from them. They should learn from them. Or want to know more about topics. After all, if students are produced, the summer project will make more students work hard with their efforts.</td>\n",

Or have you been following the teachers orders but your teacher is moving at a faster pace than you can learn? Some students have these problems in public schools so I'm going to be explaining the reasons why students learning at their own pace without any distractions at home will benefit more than students learning in a public school.\\n\\nOne reason I believe students will benefit more from doing work at home is because they won't get distracted from other students who mess around a lot during class. Students messing around could cause other students to get distracted and not focus on their work or what the teacher is trying to lecture. If they were getting educated online at home, they wouldn't get distracted by anyone because they're alone. Being alone at home in a one on one conversation between the teacher and the student wouldn't cause any distractions for the student.\\n\\nAnother reason I believe students would benefit by being taught online rather than in a public school is because teachers teach at a class pace and there are some students out there that can't learn at a class pace so they fall behind and have to catch up on work later. If the student were getting taught at home, they can go at any pace they want and won't fall behind. Not falling behind will be really beneficial to students because some get really stressed out when they have a lot of work to do.\\n\\nMy final reason on why students being taught at home would benefit them more than students being taught at public schools is that they will get a good understanding of the curriculum. In public schools, you could possibly get a teacher that you dont like or one that can't teach well. This could cause you to not understand what the teacher is lecturing. If the student was taking the class online, they would get a teacher that they would like or they would just learn the material themselves by reading.\\n\\nTaking school online at home does have down sides such as not getting much public speaking skills which could cause some people to be anti-social but thats easy to overcome. Not getting distracted, learning at your own pace, and getting a teacher that you like are some of many of the reasons why I believe that students being taught online would benefit more than students being taught in a public school.</td>\n",

Or are you always paying attention to the teacher's order, but your teacher's pace is faster than you can learn? Some students have these problems in public schools, so I have to explain the reasons why students learn from their own pace without any interference, which is more than students studying in public schools.\\n\\nI think the reason why students work at home are more benefited because they will not be distracted by other students who are chaotic from class during class. The messy students may distract other students, rather than focusing on their work or teachers attempting to give lectures. If they are educated at home, they will not be distracted by a person. In one -to -one dialogue between teachers and students, a person will not bring any interference to the students at home.\\n\\nI think that the other reason that students will benefit from online teaching rather than in public schools are because teachers teach in the classroom. Some students cannot learn in the classroom, so they lag behind to go to work. If students are taught at home, they can do it at any speed they want without falling behind. Not behind will be really good for students, because when they have a lot of work to do, some people really feel pressure.\\n\\nThe reason why I have benefited why students who are teaching at home than to teach in public schools are that they will have a good understanding of the course. In public schools, you may get a teacher you don't like or a teacher who can't be very good. This may cause you not to know the teacher's lecture. If the students are going online, they will get the teacher they want, otherwise they will only learn the materials through reading.\\n\\nThere is indeed a faint aspect of online school at home. For example, not obtaining too many public speech skills, which may cause some people to fight against society, but it is easy to overcome. There is no distraction, studying according to your own rhythm, and getting your favorite teacher. This is why I think that students who are teaching online are more reasons than students who teach in public schools.</td>\n",

In my opinion, half of the population will eventually vote for someone, because he provides bad benefits, and then we will be with another bad president for 4 years! Who knows Congress more about Congress? Let us honestly here, we really hope that all our taxes will bring families with 8 children, we cannot afford two ass or begging for money on the side of the road, or waste people to call Crack Crack Crack Crack Ack Crack Ack Ack Ack Crack Sister Stay Sister Stail Sister. money? not me!\\n\\nThis article pointed out that yes, voters can choose to be different from the people and popularity. I don't think this is important because they want to vote to those who are not suitable for presidents? If they are there, they will be suitable. Therefore, I think the election college is well applied to the United States of America. Yes, maybe our voters can't see some benefits, and a person may provide or not understand why your eyes may be better. But in the end, the president we chose may not even really do half of his promise, so who cares?\\n\\nIf we want this country to take anything, we need to let those who truly understand the loses tell the American people that a bunch of lies are indeed provided for us. They know what are the benefits of us, and this is why they vote to support them.\\n\\nI hope you know where I come from.\\n\\nThank you, appropriate _Name</td>\n",

When the image appeared on the JPL website for the first time, it was found that it was a natural terrain.\\n\\nIn my opinion, if the aliens really created their faces, there will be more evidence or proof that aliens create their faces. Because there are more evidence that the face is created by natural terrain. If evidence of the faces created by aliens, not the natural terrain, then I am not sure what will do.\\n\\nFinally, I found that the faces generated by natural terrain had more evidence than the faces created by aliens. More people are talking about it by aliens, and some people say that there is evidence that the face is created by the aliens. However, I have to say that I will adhere to more evidence about the faces created by natural lanterns.</td>\n",

       "0      084BB657A9C4  Summer projects are what most students dread during their break, but they are necessary for students to keep expanding their minds during the summer. Most of the time these projects are designed by the teachers, but normally those projects are not as fun to do. While student-designed projects would be more interesting for a student to learn from and they would enjoy it more. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would be easier for the students to understand, it would give more reason for students to do it and put effort in to the project over their summer vacation, and it would be an appealing and fun method of learning for the students.\\n\\nThese student-designed summer projects are normally easier to understand for students. Generic_Name is a student at a middle school and he has to do a summer project, which was a project about what is the hardest part of school and creating a PowerPoint on it which was created by a student in his grade. When his summer started,Generic_Name could clearly read what he is supposed to do for his project and he could get to it right away. He created one of his most enjoyable PowerPoints because it was easier for him to talk and write about, when it was teacher designed, the project was about explaining into depth why ones years in middle school are the hardest years of schooling, he took a lot of time trying to understand what the project really was and how it worked. Generic_Name could understand the project more since it was made by a student and it would be easier for a student to understand a student than a student trying to understand a teacher. Generic_Name is a 5th grade student who has a summer project. Going into 6th grade next school year, Generic_Name has to do a project on what middle school is going to be like for him as a student, which is what he has to think about anyways since he is going into middle school. Students in his grade would know what kids their age would understand and what they are normally thinking of which was in his case going into middle school. In student-designed projects for the summer, students would understand these projects more because students understand what other students are thinking of and are going through.\\n\\nThese type of summer projects would give students more of a reason to put effort and actually do the project. Generic_Name, a student who wants to become a website designer, is asked to do a summer project in his IT class. The project was creating a poster of something one would like to do for their profession in IT, this project was created by a student in his IT class whom which knew that students would not like a project about one topic. When it got to the summer Generic_Name was more motivated to get his project done because he could talk about his passion which was website design. Generic_Name put more effort into his project because it was created by a student who understood other students would not like to talk about a single topic. Generic_Name, a photography student, has a summer project on what their summer vacation is like in pictures for his photography class, this project was made by a student in his photography class. Generic_Name put more effort into it because it is something he found interesting and he had more of a reason to take pictures of even though years prior his teacher made projects about taking a photograph of an exotic animal and write a paper about it, he liked this idea for a project because he could just enjoy his summer vacation while also doing his summer project at the same time. Students find these summer projects more interesting and put more effort into it because they are made by other students in their classes.\\n\\nSummer projects that are student-designed would likely appeal to students making them more fun for the students learn during the project. A high school engineering class is given a summer project, they are asked to build a model rocket, which was a project idea created by a student. The class when they went on summer vacation, had more fun because they got to build something that was more interesting, appealing, and fun for them as students and as young engineers. These students also learned a lot about how rockets work and how the engineering process goes into them. An AP history class is given a summer project, which they are asked to create an alternate historical scenario in which something that happened in history, just did not occur or was altered a little bit, this project idea was created but a student in this AP history class. The students in this class during their summer spent time researching a specific event that they found interesting and tweaked it to their liking, this gave them the power to do whatever they want with history and they found it fun because they learned more about specific events in history and got to change them to completely different scenarios. Summer projects that are student-designed are more fun to the students in these classes because students in those specific class would know what other students would find fun and appeal toward them.\\n\\nStudent-designed summer projects are better for students than teacher-designed ones because they are more for fun for the student to make, they are easier to understand for the students because students learn more from other students, and they would put more effort into those projects because students know what other students in their grade like. Summer projects are a lot of work for students, but if students were allowed to design these projects so that they would appeal to other kids in their classes or their grade more students would do those summer projects and expand their knowledge on topics they should learn or want to learn more about. Overall, summer projects would have more students working on them with strong effort if they were made by students.               1021  Summer projects are what most students dread during their break, but they are necessary for students to keep expanding their minds during the summer.

Generic_Name is a student at a middle school and he has to do a summer project, which was a project about what is the hardest part of school and creating a PowerPoint on it which was created by a student in his grade. When his summer started,Generic_Name could clearly read what he is supposed to do for his project and he could get to it right away. He created one of his most enjoyable PowerPoints because it was easier for him to talk and write about, when it was teacher designed, the project was about explaining into depth why ones years in middle school are the hardest years of schooling, he took a lot of time trying to understand what the project really was and how it worked. Generic_Name could understand the project more since it was made by a student and it would be easier for a student to understand a student than a student trying to understand a teacher. Generic_Name is a 5th grade student who has a summer project. Going into 6th grade next school year, Generic_Name has to do a project on what middle school is going to be like for him as a student, which is what he has to think about anyways since he is going into middle school. Students in his grade would know what kids their age would understand and what they are normally thinking of which was in his case going into middle school. In student-designed projects for the summer, students would understand these projects more because students understand what other students are thinking of and are going through.\\n\\nThese type of summer projects would give students more of a reason to put effort and actually do the project. Generic_Name, a student who wants to become a website designer, is asked to do a summer project in his IT class. The project was creating a poster of something one would like to do for their profession in IT, this project was created by a student in his IT class whom which knew that students would not like a project about one topic. When it got to the summer Generic_Name was more motivated to get his project done because he could talk about his passion which was website design. Generic_Name put more effort into his project because it was created by a student who understood other students would not like to talk about a single topic. Generic_Name, a photography student, has a summer project on what their summer vacation is like in pictures for his photography class, this project was made by a student in his photography class. Generic_Name put more effort into it because it is something he found interesting and he had more of a reason to take pictures of even though years prior his teacher made projects about taking a photograph of an exotic animal and write a paper about it, he liked this idea for a project because he could just enjoy his summer vacation while also doing his summer project at the same time. Students find these summer projects more interesting and put more effort into it because they are made by other students in their classes.\\n\\nSummer projects that are student-designed would likely appeal to students making them more fun for the students learn during the project. A high school engineering class is given a summer project, they are asked to build a model rocket, which was a project idea created by a student. The class when they went on summer vacation, had more fun because they got to build something that was more interesting, appealing, and fun for them as students and as young engineers. These students also learned a lot about how rockets work and how the engineering process goes into them. An AP history class is given a summer project, which they are asked to create an alternate historical scenario in which something that happened in history, just did not occur or was altered a little bit, this project idea was created but a student in this AP history class. The students in this class during their summer spent time researching a specific event that they found interesting and tweaked it to their liking, this gave them the power to do whatever they want with history and they found it fun because they learned more about specific events in history and got to change them to completely different scenarios. Summer projects that are student-designed are more fun to the students in these classes because students in those specific class would know what other students would find fun and appeal toward them.\\n\\nStudent-designed summer projects are better for students than teacher-designed ones because they are more for fun for the student to make, they are easier to understand for the students because students learn more from other students, and they would put more effort into those projects because students know what other students in their grade like. Summer projects are a lot of work for students, but if students were allowed to design these projects so that they would appeal to other kids in their classes or their grade more students would do those summer projects and expand their knowledge on topics they should learn or want to learn more about. Overall, summer projects would have more students working on them with strong effort if they were made by students.  夏季项目是大多数学生在休息期间的恐惧，但是学生在夏季必须继续扩展自己的思想是必要的。这些项目大多数是由老师设计的，但通常这些项目并不那么有趣。学生设计的项目对于学生学习而将更加有趣，他们会更喜欢它。应该为学生设计的夏季项目，因为学生更容易理解，这将为学生提供更多的理由。在暑假期间为该项目付出努力，这将是一种吸引学生学习的有趣和有趣的方法。这些学生设计的夏季项目通常更容易理解。Generic_name是一所中学的学生，他必须做一个夏季项目，这是一个关于学校最困难的项目，并在其成绩中创建的PowerPoint是什么。能清楚地阅读他应该为自己的项目做的事情，他可以马上才能完成。他创建了他最愉快的PowerPoint之一关于深入解释为什么中学的几年是最难学年的学年，他花了很多时间试图了解该项目的真正含义以及如何工作。Generic_name可以更多地了解该项目，因为它是由学生制作的，与试图理解老师的学生相比，学生了解学生要容易。Generic_name是一个有一个夏季项目的5年级学生。下一个学年进入六年级，generic_name必须在哪个中学上做一个项目自从他进入中学以来，他就会想像他一样，这是他必须考虑的。成绩的研究员会知道他们年龄的孩子会理解什么以及他们通常在想什么在他的情况下，这是进入中学的。付出努力并实际进行项目的理由。generic_name是一个想成为网站设计师的学生，被要求在其IT课中进行夏季项目。该项目正在创建一个人想为他们的职业做的事情的海报在其中，这个项目是由他的IT课中的一个学生创建的，该学生知道学生不喜欢一个关于一个主题的项目。到达夏季时，Generic_name更有动力完成他的项目，因为他可以谈论自己的热情是网站设计。Generic_name在他的项目中付出了更多的努力，因为它是由一个学生创建的，他们了解其他学生不想说话关于一个主题。Generic_name是一名摄影专业的学生，​​有一个夏季项目，讲述了他们的摄影课程中暑假的样子，这个项目是由他的摄影班级学生制作的。Generic_name在其中付出了更多的努力，因为它是他发现有趣的事，他有更多理由可以拍照，即使他的老师在他的老师制作了有关拍摄异国动物照片并写一篇论文的项目，他喜欢这个项目，因为他可以享受他的暑假也在同时进行夏季项目的同时。学生发现这些夏季项目更有趣，并为此付出了更多的努力，因为它们是由其他ST制造的学生设计的夏季项目可能会吸引学生在项目期间为学生学习更有趣的学生。一个高中工程课程是一个夏季项目，他们被要求建造一个模特的火箭，是一个学生创造的项目想法。班级去暑假时，他们会更加有趣，因为他们必须为学生和年轻的工程师构建一些更有趣，吸引人和乐趣的东西。这些学生还学会了一个关于火箭如何工作以及工程过程如何进入它们。给了一个AP历史课，他们被要求创建一种替代的历史场景，其中发生在历史上发生的事情，只是没有发生或被改变有点，这个项目的想法是创造的，但是在此AP历史课上的一名学生。夏季，这堂课的学生花时间研究了一个特定的活动，他们发现有趣的事件并将其调整为他们的喜好，这使他们有能力在历史上做他们想做的任何事情，他们发现它很有趣，因为他们了解了更多有关历史上的特定事件并将其更改为完全不同的场景。学生设计的夏季项目更有趣这些课程的学生是因为这些特定班级的学生会知道其他学生会发现什么乐趣和吸引他们。设计的夏季项目比学生更好，因为他们更乐意为学生创造，使学生更有趣对于学生来说，他们更容易理解，因为学生向其他学生学习更多，并且他们会为这些项目付出更多的努力，因为学生知道他们的成绩中的其他学生。夏季项目对学生来说是很多工作，但是如果学生是允许设计这些项目，以便他们在课堂上吸引其他孩子，或者他们的成绩越来越多的学生将进行这些夏季项目并扩大其KNO他们应该学习或想了解更多有关主题。毕竟，如果学生制作的话，夏季项目将使更多的学生在他们的努力下努力。  Summer projects are the fear of most students during the rest, but students must continue to expand their thoughts in summer. Most of these projects are designed by teachers, but these projects are usually not so interesting.

He created one of his most pleasant Powerpoints about why the middle school was the most difficult academic year for the years. He spent a lot of time trying to understand the true meaning and how to work in the project. GENERIC_NAME can understand the project more because it is made by students. Compared with students who try to understand the teacher, students understand that students are easy to understand. GENERIC_NAME is a 5th grade student with a summer project. In the next school year, entering the sixth grade, Generic_name must do a project in which middle school he has ever imagined him since he entered middle school. This is what he must consider. Researchers with grades will know what their age will understand and what they usually think of in him. Reasons for the effort and actual project. GENERIC_NAME is a student who wants to be a website designer and is asked to carry out summer projects in its IT class. The project is creating a poster of a person who wants to do for their career. This project is created by a student in his IT class. The student knows that the student does not like a theme project.When you arrive in summer, Generic_name is more motivated to complete his project because he can talk about his enthusiasm as the website design. GENERIC_NAME has made more efforts in his project, because it is created by a student, and they know that other students do not want to talk about a theme. GENERIC_NAME is a student of photography. There is a summer project that tells about their photography course of the heat. This project is produced by his photography class students. GENERIC_NAME has made more efforts in it, because it is an interesting thing that he has found, and he has more reasons to take pictures. Even if his teacher made a project about taking foreign animals and writing a paper on his teacher, He likes this project because he can enjoy his summer vacation while carrying out the summer project at the same time. Students have found that these summer projects are more interesting, and they have made more efforts for this, because they are designed by other ST -made summer projects that may attract students to learn more interesting students for students during the project. A high school engineering course is a summer project. They are required to build a model rocket, which is a project idea created by a student. When the class goes to the summer vacation, they will be more interesting because they must build some more interesting, attractive and fun things for students and young engineers. These students have also learned how to work in the Rockets and how to enter them. Given an AP history lesson, they were asked to create a alternative historical scene, which happened in history, but it did not happen or changed. The idea of ​​this project was created, but in this AP history class A student. In summer, students in this lesson spend time studying a specific activity. They discover interesting events and adjust them to their preferences, which makes them have the ability to do anything they want to do in history.

Or have you been following the teachers orders but your teacher is moving at a faster pace than you can learn? Some students have these problems in public schools so I'm going to be explaining the reasons why students learning at their own pace without any distractions at home will benefit more than students learning in a public school.\\n\\nOne reason I believe students will benefit more from doing work at home is because they won't get distracted from other students who mess around a lot during class. Students messing around could cause other students to get distracted and not focus on their work or what the teacher is trying to lecture. If they were getting educated online at home, they wouldn't get distracted by anyone because they're alone. Being alone at home in a one on one conversation between the teacher and the student wouldn't cause any distractions for the student.\\n\\nAnother reason I believe students would benefit by being taught online rather than in a public school is because teachers teach at a class pace and there are some students out there that can't learn at a class pace so they fall behind and have to catch up on work later. If the student were getting taught at home, they can go at any pace they want and won't fall behind. Not falling behind will be really beneficial to students because some get really stressed out when they have a lot of work to do.\\n\\nMy final reason on why students being taught at home would benefit them more than students being taught at public schools is that they will get a good understanding of the curriculum. In public schools, you could possibly get a teacher that you dont like or one that can't teach well. This could cause you to not understand what the teacher is lecturing. If the student was taking the class online, they would get a teacher that they would like or they would just learn the material themselves by reading.\\n\\nTaking school online at home does have down sides such as not getting much public speaking skills which could cause some people to be anti-social but thats easy to overcome. Not getting distracted, learning at your own pace, and getting a teacher that you like are some of many of the reasons why I believe that students being taught online would benefit more than students being taught in a public school.                431                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Have you ever been trying to pay attention in class but your friends or someone in your class is being a major distraction? Or have you been following the teachers orders but your teacher is moving at a faster pace than you can learn? Some students have these problems in public schools so I'm going to be explaining the reasons why students learning at their own pace without any distractions at home will benefit more than students learning in a public school.\\n\\nOne reason I believe students will benefit more from doing work at home is because they won't get distracted from other students who mess around a lot during class. Students messing around could cause other students to get distracted and not focus on their work or what the teacher is trying to lecture. If they were getting educated online at home, they wouldn't get distracted by anyone because they're alone. Being alone at home in a one on one conversation between the teacher and the student wouldn't cause any distractions for the student.\\n\\nAnother reason I believe students would benefit by being taught online rather than in a public school is because teachers teach at a class pace and there are some students out there that can't learn at a class pace so they fall behind and have to catch up on work later. If the student were getting taught at home, they can go at any pace they want and won't fall behind. Not falling behind will be really beneficial to students because some get really stressed out when they have a lot of work to do.\\n\\nMy final reason on why students being taught at home would benefit them more than students being taught at public schools is that they will get a good understanding of the curriculum. In public schools, you could possibly get a teacher that you dont like or one that can't teach well. This could cause you to not understand what the teacher is lecturing. If the student was taking the class online, they would get a teacher that they would like or they would just learn the material themselves by reading.\\n\\nTaking school online at home does have down sides such as not getting much public speaking skills which could cause some people to be anti-social but thats easy to overcome. Not getting distracted, learning at your own pace, and getting a teacher that you like are some of many of the reasons why I believe that students being taught online would benefit more than students being taught in a public school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        您是否曾经在课堂上关注，但是您的朋友或班上的某人是主要的分心？还是您一直在关注老师的命令，但是您的老师的步伐比您所能学到的要快？有些学生在公立学校有这些问题，因此我要解释学生以自己的步调学习而没有任何干扰的原因，这比在公立学校学习的学生更多。\\n\\n我认为学生在家中工作会更受益的原因之一是因为他们不会从上课时大量混乱的其他学生分心。乱七八糟的学生可能会使其他学生分心，而不是专注于他们的工作或老师试图讲课。如果他们在家中接受教育，他们不会因为一个人而分心。在老师和学生之间的一对一对话中，一个人在家中不会给学生带来任何干扰。\\n\\n我认为学生会通过在线教学而不是在公立学校中受益的另一个原因是因为老师在课堂上教书，有些学生无法在课堂上学习，所以他们落后于落后以后上班。如果学生在家中被教导，他们可以以他们想要的任何速度进行，不会落后。不落后会对学生真正有益，因为当他们有很多工作要做时，有些人真的会感到压力。\\n\\n我关于为什么在家教学的学生比在公立学校教授的学生更受益的原因是，他们将对课程有很好的了解。在公立学校中，您可能会得到一位您不喜欢的老师或不能很好的教师。这可能会导致您不了解老师在讲课。如果学生在网上上课，他们会得到他们想要的老师，否则他们只会通过阅读来学习材料。\\n\\n在家中在线上学的确有淡淡的方面，例如没有获得太多公开演讲技巧，这可能会导致某些人反社会，但很容易克服。没有分心，按照自己的节奏学习，并得到您喜欢的老师，这是我认为在网上教授的学生比在公立学校教授的学生更多的原因。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Have you ever paid attention to in the classroom, but your friend or someone in the class is the main distraction? Or are you always paying attention to the teacher's order, but your teacher's pace is faster than you can learn? Some students have these problems in public schools, so I have to explain the reasons why students learn from their own pace without any interference, which is more than students studying in public schools.\\n\\nI think the reason why students work at home are more benefited because they will not be distracted by other students who are chaotic from class during class. The messy students may distract other students, rather than focusing on their work or teachers attempting to give lectures. If they are educated at home, they will not be distracted by a person. In one -to -one dialogue between teachers and students, a person will not bring any interference to the students at home.\\n\\nI think that the other reason that students will benefit from online teaching rather than in public schools are because teachers teach in the classroom. Some students cannot learn in the classroom, so they lag behind to go to work. If students are taught at home, they can do it at any speed they want without falling behind. Not behind will be really good for students, because when they have a lot of work to do, some people really feel pressure.\\n\\nThe reason why I have benefited why students who are teaching at home than to teach in public schools are that they will have a good understanding of the course. In public schools, you may get a teacher you don't like or a teacher who can't be very good. This may cause you not to know the teacher's lecture. If the students are going online, they will get the teacher they want, otherwise they will only learn the materials through reading.\\n\\nThere is indeed a faint aspect of online school at home. For example, not obtaining too many public speech skills, which may cause some people to fight against society, but it is easy to overcome. There is no distraction, studying according to your own rhythm, and getting your favorite teacher. This is why I think that students who are teaching online are more reasons than students who teach in public schools.\n",

Cars are one of the most purchased and used items of our world and without owing a vehicle or having other means of transportation, life would practically be hard. The world around us is constantly changing and with change comes new and fresh ideas. One of the new ideas that is thought to help improve our lives are driverless cars. Driverless cars (also known as taxis) are cars that can drive themselves around while the passengers are at rest as they wait to arrive at their destination. Although driverless cars sound exciting and fun, are they really? These new driverless cars are not completely driver-less, take the fun out of driving, and will cause several issues down the road dealing with accidents and injuries.\\n\\nGoogle has created cars that are driverless and that can drive themselves under certain conditions. However, these cars are not completely driverless. Driverless cars tell the driver to take over the wheel when the car itself cannot perform human driving skills. Such as pulling in and out of driveways,going through accidents and construction sites,and on certain roads and streets. Driverless cars can acccelerate, steer, and brake themselves but overall these cars are still not completely driver-less. The point of having a driverless car is being able to simply enjoy not having to drive, not wait until it is your turn to take over the wheel.\\n\\nTake a look around you. We have smartphones, computers, and even elevators to help make our lives easier. Studies have shown that the country that has the highest obesity levels and that also happen to be the laziest are Americans. Technology is the creation of something that helps make doing ordinary tasks easier and according to many doctors these new inventions involving computers and phones have made us more and more lazy. So what's next ;cars that drive themselves? What happened to taking a drivers test at the age of 16 and praying that you passed ? What happened to the thrill of being able to drive your parents car (legally) for the first time? Is that now going to be taken over by these new driverless cars? Driverless cars would in fact take the fun out of driving.\\n\\nOverall driving has become the worlds' \"norm\" for our way of living. Yes, having a car that can assist you while driving would be very helpful, but having a car that drives for you would not. In that case, what would be the point of owning a car when you could instead call a taxi? Everyday our world is changing. Ideas and inventions are growing bigger and better by the second. Driverless cars are smart and creative inventions but cars were created to help make our lives easier;not live our lives for us.                476                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Technology involving computers, smartphones, and even cars are slowly but surely taking over our lives.

Driverless cars are smart and creative inventions but cars were created to help make our lives easier;not live our lives for us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    涉及计算机，智能手机甚至汽车的技术正在缓慢但肯定会接管我们的生活。汽车是我们世界上购买和使用最多的物品之一，没有欠车或拥有其他运输方式，生活实际上是艰难的。我们周围的世界在不断变化，随着变化的发展，新的想法是新的。被认为有助于改善我们生活的新想法之一是无人驾驶汽车。无人驾驶汽车（也称为出租车）是汽车，可以在乘客到达目的地时休息时开车四处走动。尽管无人驾驶汽车听起来很令人兴奋又有趣，但它们真的吗？这些新的无人驾驶汽车并非完全没有驾驶员，从驾驶中取得乐趣，并会在处理事故和伤害的道路上引起一些问题。\\n\\nGoogle创建了无人驾驶的汽车，可以在某些条件下驱动自己。但是，这些汽车并非完全无人驾驶。无人驾驶汽车告诉驾驶员在汽车本身无法执行人类驾驶技能时接管方向盘。例如，在车道和街道和街道上拉进出车道，穿越事故和建筑工地。无人驾驶汽车可以加速，转向和刹车，但总体而言，这些汽车仍然并非完全没有驾驶员。拥有无人驾驶汽车的目的是能够简单地享受不必开车，不要等到轮到您接管方向盘的时候。\\n\\n环顾四周。我们拥有智能手机，计算机甚至电梯，以帮助我们的生活更轻松。研究表明，这个国家的肥胖水平最高，也是最懒惰的国家是美国人。技术是创造一些有助于使普通任务更轻松的事情，据许多医生称，这些涉及计算机和电话的新发明使我们越来越懒惰。那么接下来是什么？在16岁时参加驾驶员考试并祈祷您通过的情况发生了什么？能够第一次（合法地）开车驾驶父母汽车的激动是怎么回事？这些新的无人驾驶汽车现在要接管了吗？实际上，无人驾驶汽车会从驾驶中取得乐趣。\\n\\n总体驾驶已成为我们的生活方式的世界“规范”。是的，拥有可以在开车时为您提供帮助的汽车将非常有帮助，但是有一辆为您开车的汽车不会。在这种情况下，当您可以打电话时，拥有汽车的意义是什么？我们的世界每天都在变化。思想和发明越来越大。无人驾驶汽车是聪明而富有创造力的发明，但是创建了汽车来帮助我们的生活更轻松；而不是为我们过着我们的生活。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The technology involved in computers, smartphones and even cars is slow but will definitely take over our lives. Cars are one of the most purchased and used items in our world. There is no owe car or other transportation methods. Life is actually difficult. The world around us is constantly changing. With the development of changes, new ideas are new. One of the new ideas for helping to improve our lives is unmanned cars. Unmanned cars (also known as taxis) are cars, and they can drive around when passengers rest at their destination. Although unmanned cars sound exciting and interesting, are they really? These new unmanned cars are not completely without drivers. They get fun from driving and will cause some problems on the road to deal with accidents and injuries.\\n\\nGoogle has created unmanned cars that can drive yourself under certain conditions. However, these cars are not completely unmanned. Unmanned cars tell the driver to take over the steering wheel when the car itself cannot perform human driving skills. For example, pull the lanes in the lane and streets and streets to cross accidents and construction sites. Unmanned cars can accelerate, steering and brakes, but in general, these cars are still not completely without drivers. The purpose of having a driverless car is to simply enjoy the time when you turn your car, not to take over the steering wheel.\\n\\nlook around. We have smartphones, computers and even elevators to help our lives easier. Studies have shown that this country has the highest level of obesity and the most lazy country is Americans. Technology is to create something that helps to make ordinary tasks easier. According to many doctors, these new inventions involving computers and telephones make us more and more lazy. So what is the next? At the age of 16, what happened to the driver's test and prayed for your passing? What is the excitement of driving parents cars for the first time (legal)? Are these new unmanned cars be taken over now? In fact, unmanned cars will get fun from driving.\\n\\nOverall driving has become the \"standard\" of our lifestyle. Yes, it will be very helpful to have a car that can help you when driving, but a car driving for you will not. In this case, when you can call, what is the significance of a car? Our world is changing every day. Thoughts and inventions are getting bigger and bigger. Unmanned cars are intelligent and creative inventions, but it is easier to create cars to help our lives; instead of living our lives for us.\n",

That's what Luke Bomberger was. Luke Bomberger was a Sea Cowboy that helped animals cross thje Atlantic Ocean. I have two reasons why you should join the program.\\n\\nThe first reason is that if you care about animals this is the right job for you because, at this job you have to take care of them by feeding and cleaning. The animals you will be taking care of are horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped over sea. The second reason is that if you want to be a cowboy, this is the right job for you because, you are dealing with cows, horses, and mules like every cowboy or girl.\\n\\nOther people might have an argument about it. They might say that it's boring and stupid but, it's really not boring or stupid. It would be really fun if you wanted to be a cowboy or cowgirl, and liked animals                163

       您是否想帮助动物越过大西洋？那就是卢克·鲍伯格（Luke Bomberger）。卢克·鲍伯格（Luke Bomberger）是一位海牛仔，帮助动物越过大西洋。我有两个原因，您应该加入该计划。\\n\\n第一个原因是，如果您关心动物，这是适合您的工作，因为在这项工作下，您必须通过喂食和清洁来照顾它们。您将要照顾的动物是在海上运送的马，幼牛和mu子。第二个原因是，如果您想成为一名牛仔，这对您来说是正确的工作，因为您正在与牛，马和小mu ule牛，例如每个牛仔或女孩。\\n\\n其他人可能对此有所争议。他们可能会说这很无聊和愚蠢，但是，这确实不是无聊或愚蠢的。如果您想成为牛仔或牛仔，并且喜欢动物，那真的很有趣

want to help animals cross the Atlantic Ocean?That's Luke Bomberger.Luke Bomberger is a sea cow, helping animals cross the Atlantic Ocean.I have two reasons, you should join the plan.\\n\\nThe first reason is that if you care about animals, this is suitable for your job, because under this work, you must take care of them by feeding and cleaning.The animals you are going to take care of are horses, young cows and MUs that are transported at sea.The second reason is that if you want to be a cowboy, this is the right job for you, because you are coming with cow, horses and small Mu Ule

Our country is so messed up that we have a lot of our people not working or just getting well-fair. To be honest, that isnt fair that they get a vote. Who are they going to choose when it comes to voting? Someone trying to help us move forward or someone making our tax money got to the people who dont want to get off there lazy butt and do something. I do not know 100% of the facts on who can vote or not, but if a bum sitting on state road 70 all day begging for money just so he can go buy beer, seems unfair that he should even get a vote. In my opinion half of the population will end up voting for someone because, of what bad benefits he is offering and then we will be stuck with another bad president for another 4 years! Who knows more about congress then our congress? Lets be a honest here, do we really want all our tax money going to families with 8 kids and cant afford 2 or the bums on the side of the road begging for money or the trashy people hitting up crack ever time they get a little bit of money? Not me!\\n\\nThe article states that yes the electors may choose differently from what the people and the popularity wanted. I dont think that matters because why would they vote for someone who isnt fit to be president? If they are even up there, they are fit. So I think the Electoral College is just fine of a process to use for the United States of America.

Our country is so messed up that we have a lot of our people not working or just getting well-fair. To be honest, that isnt fair that they get a vote. Who are they going to choose when it comes to voting? Someone trying to help us move forward or someone making our tax money got to the people who dont want to get off there lazy butt and do something. I do not know 100% of the facts on who can vote or not, but if a bum sitting on state road 70 all day begging for money just so he can go buy beer, seems unfair that he should even get a vote. In my opinion half of the population will end up voting for someone because, of what bad benefits he is offering and then we will be stuck with another bad president for another 4 years! Who knows more about congress then our congress? Lets be a honest here, do we really want all our tax money going to families with 8 kids and cant afford 2 or the bums on the side of the road begging for money or the trashy people hitting up crack ever time they get a little bit of money? Not me!\\n\\nThe article states that yes the electors may choose differently from what the people and the popularity wanted. I dont think that matters because why would they vote for someone who isnt fit to be president? If they are even up there, they are fit. So I think the Electoral College is just fine of a process to use for the United States of America. Yes, maybe our electors dont see certain benefits one canidate might be offering or doesnt understand as to why one might be better in your eyes. But in the end, the president we choose is probably not even going to actually do half the things he promised so who cares?\\n\\nIf we want this country to go anywere we need to let the people who actually understand what the men up on the campains telling the people of america a bunch of lies really offer us. They know whats good for us and thats why they are voting for them.\\n\\nI hope you understand where I am coming from.\\n\\nThank You, PROPER_NAME

亲爱的参议员，\\n\\n我觉得您应该保持选举学院。我们的国家是如此混乱，以至于我们有很多人不工作或仅仅是好事。老实说，他们得到投票并不公平。他们将在投票时选择谁？有人试图帮助我们前进，或者有人赚钱的人会给那些不想在那儿下车的人懒惰的屁股做某事。我不知道关于谁可以投票的事实中的100％，但是如果整天坐在70岁的州立公路上乞求钱，以便他可以去买啤酒，那么似乎不公平，他甚至应该得到投票。在我看来，一半的人口最终会投票支持某人，因为他所提供的不良好处，然后我们将与另一位坏总统在一起是4年！谁对国会更了解国会？让我们诚实地在这里，我们真的希望我们所有的税金带给有8个孩子的家庭，不能负担2个或在道路侧面乞求钱的屁股，或者浪费的人打crack crack crack crack crack ack crack ack crack sister stay sister stail sister。钱？不是我！\\n\\n这篇文章指出，是的，选民可以选择与人民和受欢迎程度不同。我不认为这很重要，因为他们为什么要投票给不适合担任总统的人？如果他们甚至在那里，他们都会合适。因此，我认为选举学院很好地适用于美利坚合众国。是的，也许我们的选民看不到某些好处，一个人可能会提供或不明白为什么您的眼睛可能会更好。但是最后，我们选择的总统甚至可能不会真正做他承诺的一半，所以谁在乎？\\n\\n如果我们希望这个国家走任何事情，我们需要让那些真正理解露营者的人告诉美国人民，一堆谎言确实为我们提供了。他们知道对我们有什么好处，这就是为什么他们投票支持他们。\\n\\n希望您了解我来自哪里。\\n\\n谢谢你，适当的_name

        Dear Senate,\\n\\nI think you should keep the college. Our country is so chaotic that many of us are not working or just good things. Honestly, they are not fair to be voted. Who will they choose during voting? Some people try to help us move forward, or some people who make money will do something lazy with those who don't want to get off there. I don't know 100 % of the facts about who can vote, but if he is sitting on a 70 -year -old state highway all day to beg for money, so that he can buy beer, then it seems unfair and he should even be voted. In my opinion, half of the population will eventually vote for someone, because he provides bad benefits, and then we will be with another bad president for 4 years! Who knows Congress more about Congress? Let us honestly here, we really hope that all our taxes will bring families with 8 children, we cannot afford two ass or begging for money on the side of the road, or waste people to call Crack Crack Crack Crack Ack Crack Ack Ack Ack Crack Sister Stay Sister Stail Sister. money? not me!\\n\\nThis article pointed out that yes, voters can choose to be different from the people and popularity. I don't think this is important because they want to vote to those who are not suitable for presidents? If they are there, they will be suitable. Therefore, I think the election college is well applied to the United States of America. Yes, maybe our voters can't see some benefits, and a person may provide or not understand why your eyes may be better. But in the end, the president we chose may not even really do half of his promise, so who cares?\\n\\nIf we want this country to take anything, we need to let those who truly understand the loses tell the American people that a bunch of lies are indeed provided for us. They know what are the benefits of us, and this is why they vote to support them.\\n\\nI hope you know where I come from.\\n\\nThank you, appropriate _Name\n",

In my opinion, I respectively agree with those students. I believe that Policy #1, \"Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time,\" should be enforced in our school for many reasons.\\n\\nFirst of all, I believe that students should have access to their cell phones during lunch periods and free times in case of an emergency, the students can contact their parents or whoever they need to talk with. If the students were to need something from their home or some other place, they can call their parents ask them to come drop it off at school.\\n\\nSecondly, all students in our school should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free periods because it is the students' free time to decide what they would like to do during that time, and if the student decides to use their cell phones to call or text people, than that should be perfectly fine. There is no harm in using cell phones, and if there were, then the students wouldn't even have cell phones in the first place.

In my opinion, I respectively agree with those students. I believe that Policy #1, \"Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time,\" should be enforced in our school for many reasons.\\n\\nFirst of all, I believe that students should have access to their cell phones during lunch periods and free times in case of an emergency, the students can contact their parents or whoever they need to talk with. If the students were to need something from their home or some other place, they can call their parents ask them to come drop it off at school.\\n\\nSecondly, all students in our school should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free periods because it is the students' free time to decide what they would like to do during that time, and if the student decides to use their cell phones to call or text people, than that should be perfectly fine. There is no harm in using cell phones, and if there were, then the students wouldn't even have cell phones in the first place. If the students are allowed to talk to each other during lunch and other free periods, then why can't they use their cell phones to communicate with each other?\\n\\nLast but not least, having cell phones in school during lunchtime and other free periods will not get in the way of their studies, because all cell phones need to be turned off during class time. There would be no distractions during class because there will be no cell phone to be distracted from. So if the students' focus in class is a worry, then it shouldn't be, because they would only be allowed to have their cell phones turned on during lunchtime and other free periods.\\n\\nI respectfully hope that you will consider my opinion on the Cell phone policy.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nYour Student\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME

尊敬的老师_NAME，\\n\\n我想到，学生想把手机带到学校并在学校使用它们。我认为，我分别同意那些学生。我相信政策＃1：“允许学生在午餐期和其他自由时间将手机带到学校并使用它们，只要上课时间关闭手机，就应该在我们的学校中执行许多原因。\\n\\n首先，我相信学生应该可以在午餐期内访问手机，并在紧急情况下自由时间，学生可以联系父母或需要与之交谈的任何人。如果学生需要在家或其他地方的某些地方，他们可以打电话给父母，要求他们在学校下车。\\n\\n其次，应该允许我们学校中的所有学生在午餐期和其他自由期内使用手机，因为这是学生在此期间决定自己想做什么的空闲时间，以及学生决定使用他们手机打电话或发短信给人，这应该很好。使用手机没有危害，如果有的话，那么学生甚至没有手机。如果允许学生在午餐和其他自由期间互相交谈，那么为什么他们不能使用手机相互通信？\\n\\n最后但并非最不重要的一点是，在午餐时间和其他自由期间在学校里有手机不会妨碍他们的学习，因为所有手机都需要在上课期间关闭。上课期间不会分心，因为没有手机会分散注意力。因此，如果学生在课堂上的重点是令人担忧的，那么就不应该这样做，因为他们只能在午餐时间和其他自由期间打开手机。\\n\\n我谨希望您会考虑我对手机政策的看法。\\n\\n真挚地，\\n\\n你的学生\\n\\n学生姓名

students wanted to bring their mobile phones to school and use them at school. I think I agree with those students. I believe the policy # 1: \"Allows students to bring their mobile phones to schools and use them in lunch and other free time. As long as they turn off their mobile phones in class, they should perform many reasons in our school.\\n\\nFirst of all, I believe that students should be able to access their mobile phones during lunch and in emergency situations. Students can contact their parents or anyone who needs to talk to them. If students need to be at home or elsewhere, they can call their parents and ask them to get off at school.\\n\\nSecondly, all students in our school should use their mobile phones during lunch and other free periods, because this is the free time of the students decided to do during this period, and the students decided to use their mobile phones to call or send text messages to people. This should be very good. There is no harm to using a mobile phone. If so, students do not even have a mobile phone. If students are allowed to talk to each other during lunch, why can't they use mobile phones to communicate with each other?\\n\\nIn the end, it is not the most unimportant point that there will be mobile phones in schools in school during lunch and other freedoms, because all mobile phones need to be closed during class. During the class, you will not be distracted, because there are no mobile phones to be decentralized. Therefore, if students focus on the classroom, they should not do this because they can only turn on their mobile phones during lunch and other freedom.\\n\\nI hope you will consider my views on mobile phone policies.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nYour student\\n\\nstudent name\n",

The ability to read your emotion is easy as said done. Why not put something like this that can read out faces inside school. Traspass their privacy. Even so, during school it would not come in handy with any student anytime during the day. Being watched by a face recongnition in the home of many, is an event many would not agree with.\\n\\nDuring the school year, for example, a high school. Where would a Facial Action Coding System fit into? This would not benifit our education other than waste it. The new technology being used on students to detect their emotions is a privacy violation. Students would not want their face being read and pictured by a new face detection. For example, in the story it says, \"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.\" With this being said, this technology invades our space. Some students don't want their emotions being let out; they might want it to keep that private information to themselves, unless they realease it by themselves. This could happen to anyone, even without them realizing it. For example, sitting in the right position across from the Facial Action Coding System, the victims emotion may be violated without their concent. In the story it reads, \"...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad might follow. But if ou frown, the next ad will be different.\" This text shows a program reading your face in real time for all the time you are on your own laptop. Having your own computer reading your face every second while being in your own home would not be welcomed to many.

The ability to read your emotion is easy as said done. Why not put something like this that can read out faces inside school. Traspass their privacy. Even so, during school it would not come in handy with any student anytime during the day. Being watched by a face recongnition in the home of many, is an event many would not agree with.\\n\\nDuring the school year, for example, a high school. Where would a Facial Action Coding System fit into? This would not benifit our education other than waste it. The new technology being used on students to detect their emotions is a privacy violation. Students would not want their face being read and pictured by a new face detection. For example, in the story it says, \"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.\" With this being said, this technology invades our space. Some students don't want their emotions being let out; they might want it to keep that private information to themselves, unless they realease it by themselves. This could happen to anyone, even without them realizing it. For example, sitting in the right position across from the Facial Action Coding System, the victims emotion may be violated without their concent. In the story it reads, \"...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad might follow. But if ou frown, the next ad will be different.\" This text shows a program reading your face in real time for all the time you are on your own laptop. Having your own computer reading your face every second while being in your own home would not be welcomed to many. It's a violation to privacy to use and our freedom.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would not be of use for students. Our minds and face are focused in a different direction rather than facing this machine to read out emotions. Whether this new technology is useful or not, it would not be of good use for a classroom full of faces.

                                                                                               随着技术的新使用，通过最简单的外观阅读某人情感的能力就在我们的掌握之内。如上所述，阅读情感的能力很容易。为什么不把可以在学校内读出面孔的类似的东西呢？束缚他们的隐私。即便如此，在放学期间，白天任何时候都不会与任何学生派上用场。被许多人不同意的事件在许多人的家中被脸部重新连接所观看。\\n\\n例如，在学年，高中。面部动作编码系统适合在哪里？除了浪费它之外，这不会束缚我们的教育。用于检测自己情绪的新技术是侵犯隐私的行为。学生们不希望通过新的面部检测来阅读和拍摄自己的脸。例如，在故事中，它说：“想象能够确切地发现其他人的感觉，即使他们试图掩盖自己的情绪。”话虽如此，这项技术侵入了我们的空间。有些学生不希望自己的情绪放松。他们可能希望它将这些私人信息保留给自己，除非他们自己遵守。即使没有他们意识到，这也可能发生在任何人身上。例如，坐在面部动作编码系统对面的正确位置，受害者的情绪可能在没有浓度的情况下被侵犯。在故事中，它读到：“……如果您在屏幕上出现网络广告时微笑，则可能会跟随Smiliar广告。但是，如果您皱眉，下一个广告将会有所不同。”本文显示了一个程序，您一直在您自己的笔记本电脑上实时阅读您的脸部。在自己的家中，让自己的计算机每秒阅读自己的脸，这不会受到许多人的欢迎。这是对隐私的侵犯和我们的自由。\\n\\n总之，面部动作编码系统不会用于学生。我们的思想和面孔专注于不同的方向，而不是面对这台机器来朗读情绪。这项新技术是否有用，对于充满面孔的教室来说，这将不充分使用。

technology, the ability to read someone's emotions through the simplest appearance lies in our grasp. As mentioned above, the ability to read emotions is easy. Why don't you read similar things in school? Best their privacy. Even so, during school, it will not come in handy with any student during the day. The incidents that many people disagrees are watched by the face in many people's homes.\\n\\nFor example, in the school year, high school. Where is the facial action coding system suitable? Except for waste of it, this will not restrain our education. New technologies used to detect their emotions are the act of violating privacy. Students do not want to read and shoot their faces through new facial testing. For example, in the story, it says: \"Imagine can accurately discover the feeling of others, even if they try to cover up their emotions.\" Speaking, this technology invades our space. Some students don't want their emotions to relax. They may want it to keep these private information to themselves unless they follow them. Even without them realized, this may happen to anyone. For example, sitting in the correct position opposite the facial action coding system, the emotions of the victim may be violated without concentration. In the story, it reads: \"... if you smile on the screen on the screen, you may follow Smiliar ads. However, if you frown, the next advertisement will be different.\" This article shows a program. You have been reading your face in real time on your own laptop. In your own home, let your computer read his face every second, which will not be welcomed by many people. This is the violation of privacy and our freedom.\\n\\nIn short, the facial action coding system will not be used for students. Our thoughts and faces are focused on different directions, not to read emotions in the face of this machine. Whether this new technology is useful will not be fully used for classrooms full of faces.\n",

There could be some good and bad about this new computer. What if some people don't like this new computer and it messes with their work or thing they are researching.\\n\\nWith the advances in technology more and more things are becoming different with the way they are used and things they can do. This system on a computer could effect someones work ethic. Does this system have a way to turn this off? If you are doing a research paper and you arent smiling, does that mean it will put you on something else. Is everything the same or do you have to learn a whole new way of doing things.\\n\\nIn the article it keeps talking about facial expressions and doesn't say anything about some of the things people use computers for like doing papers or playing games. This doesn't give us enogh information about the computer and the typers of things it does or the stuff it could do. The FACS sounds like a cool idea and thing that could work, but there are many of things that were left out.\\n\\nWhat would happen if the FACS system would break or be down because of something. Do you have to call someone in to fix it or what? With th FACS system, could it be used on a labtop? Could this be something that could fail and ruin your computer? With the system would this effect the way you may use your computer? There are to many questions that need to be answered before this could be a hit. The more I think about this FACS system the more question I come up with and the less I like it.\\n\\nThe new technology could effect many factors and wouldn't be something that could be put out there and hope it sells.

There could be some good and bad about this new computer. What if some people don't like this new computer and it messes with their work or thing they are researching.\\n\\nWith the advances in technology more and more things are becoming different with the way they are used and things they can do. This system on a computer could effect someones work ethic. Does this system have a way to turn this off? If you are doing a research paper and you arent smiling, does that mean it will put you on something else. Is everything the same or do you have to learn a whole new way of doing things.\\n\\nIn the article it keeps talking about facial expressions and doesn't say anything about some of the things people use computers for like doing papers or playing games. This doesn't give us enogh information about the computer and the typers of things it does or the stuff it could do. The FACS sounds like a cool idea and thing that could work, but there are many of things that were left out.\\n\\nWhat would happen if the FACS system would break or be down because of something. Do you have to call someone in to fix it or what? With th FACS system, could it be used on a labtop? Could this be something that could fail and ruin your computer? With the system would this effect the way you may use your computer? There are to many questions that need to be answered before this could be a hit. The more I think about this FACS system the more question I come up with and the less I like it.\\n\\nThe new technology could effect many factors and wouldn't be something that could be put out there and hope it sells. The systeem needs to have many of test done first before they just put it out there. The system doesn't make me feel like it is a winner. The more I think and write about makes me not want to tell anyone about the system. There are to many possibilites where things could go wrong. I don't think that this product would sell.

                                             使用技术在课堂上阅读学生的情感表达会影响道德或浪费金钱吗？这台新计算机可能会有一些好坏。如果有些人不喜欢这台新计算机，并且对他们正在研究的工作或事物感到困惑该怎么办。\\n\\n随着技术的进步，越来越多的事情随着它们的使用方式和可以做的事情而变得不同。计算机上的该系统可能会影响某人的职业道德。该系统是否可以将其关闭？如果您正在做研究论文，并且微笑着，那是否意味着它会让您陷入其他事情。一切都是一样的，还是您必须学习一种全新的做事方式。\\n\\n在这篇文章中，它一直在谈论面部表情，并且没有对人们使用计算机进行论文或玩游戏的某些内容说什么。这并不能为我们提供有关计算机及其所做工作打字或可能做的事情的ENOGH信息。 FACS听起来像是一个很酷的主意和可能起作用的事物，但是遗漏了很多事情。\\n\\n如果FACS系统会因某种东西而破裂或失效，将会发生什么。您是否必须打电话给某人进行修复或什么？使用TH FACS系统，可以在Labtop上使用吗？这可能会失败并破坏您的计算机吗？使用系统，这会像您使用计算机一样效果吗？有很多问题需要回答，然后才能受到打击。我对此FACS系统的想法越多，我想出的问题就越多，我喜欢它。\\n\\n新技术可能会影响许多因素，并且不会出现在那里并希望它出售的东西。收缩需要先进行许多测试，然后才能将其放在那里。该系统并不能使我觉得它是赢家。我想和写的越多，我不想告诉任何人有关该系统的信息。有很多可能的事情可能出错。我认为该产品不会出售。

morality or waste money? This new computer may have some good or bad. If some people don't like this new computer and be confused about their work or things they are studying.\\n\\nWith the advancement of technology, more and more things become different with what they use and what they can do. The system on the computer may affect someone's professional ethics. Can this system be closed? If you are doing research papers and smiling, it means it will cause you to fall into other things. Everything is the same, or you must learn a brand new way of doing things.\\n\\nIn this article, it has been talking about facial expressions and does not say something about people using computers to use computers or playing games. This does not provide us with enogh information about computers and what they do or possible. FACS sounds like a cool idea and possible things, but it has missed many things.\\n\\nIf the FACS system breaks or fails due to something, what will happen. Do you have to call someone to repair or what? Can you use the TH FACS system on Labtop? Will this fail and destroy your computer? Using the system, will this be as effective as you use your computer? There are many questions that need to be answered before they can be hit. The more I think about this FACS system, the more I think of the questions, and I like it.\\n\\nNew technologies may affect many factors and will not appear there and want to sell it. The contraction requires a lot of tests before it can be placed there. The system does not make me think it is a winner. The more I want to write, the more I don't want to tell anyone about the information about the system. There are many possible things that may be wrong. I think the product will not be sold.\n",

In this essay I will tell you if the face was created by aliens or if it was just a natural landform. Why would people think this face was created by aliens? Or was it just a natural landform? What would you think about the face being created by aliens?\\n\\nNow that we got that out of the way, Why would people think that the face was created by aliens? There was not much evidence that the aliens were the ones that created the face. People can not just go around saying that aliens caused the face to happen, Because there was very little proof that it caused by aliens. Garvin also said, \"It reminds him of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" In paragraph 12. And in paragraph 7 it also says that there was no alien momentum after all.\\n\\nAlso, Some people think that the face is just a natural landform. I think that the face was caused why a natural landform because I found more information that the face was caused by a natural landform. Like, in paragraph 7 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo and when the image first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed that it was a natural landform.\\n\\nI think that if the face was really created by aliens there would have been more evidence or proof saying that aliens had created the face. Because there was more proof saying that the face was created by a natural landform. If there was more proof about the face being created by aliens than it just being a natural landform then I am not sure what I would have done.\\n\\nLast of all, I found out that there was more proof in the face being created by a natural landform than the face being created by aliens. There was more people talking about how it was not created by aliens and there was also people saying that there was proof saying that the face was created by aliens. But, I would have to say I will stick with there being more proof about the face being created by a natural lanform.                392                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Mystery of the Unmasking Face on Mars\\n\\nIn the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" people think that the face was created by aliens. In this essay I will tell you if the face was created by aliens or if it was just a natural landform. Why would people think this face was created by aliens? Or was it just a natural landform? What would you think about the face being created by aliens?\\n\\nNow that we got that out of the way, Why would people think that the face was created by aliens? There was not much evidence that the aliens were the ones that created the face. People can not just go around saying that aliens caused the face to happen, Because there was very little proof that it caused by aliens. Garvin also said, \"It reminds him of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" In paragraph 12. And in paragraph 7 it also says that there was no alien momentum after all.\\n\\nAlso, Some people think that the face is just a natural landform. I think that the face was caused why a natural landform because I found more information that the face was caused by a natural landform. Like, in paragraph 7 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo and when the image first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed that it was a natural landform.\\n\\nI think that if the face was really created by aliens there would have been more evidence or proof saying that aliens had created the face. Because there was more proof saying that the face was created by a natural landform. If there was more proof about the face being created by aliens than it just being a natural landform then I am not sure what I would have done.\\n\\nLast of all, I found out that there was more proof in the face being created by a natural landform than the face being created by aliens. There was more people talking about how it was not created by aliens and there was also people saying that there was proof saying that the face was created by aliens. But, I would have to say I will stick with there being more proof about the face being created by a natural lanform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                火星上揭露面孔的奥秘\\n\\n在“揭开火星上的面孔”的文章中，人们认为面孔是由外星人创造的。在本文中，我会告诉您外星人是否创造了脸，还是只是自然的地形。人们为什么会认为这张面孔是由外星人创造的？还是只是天然地形？您如何看待外星人创造的面孔？\\n\\n既然我们已经解决了这个问题，为什么人们会认为面部是由外星人创造的？没有太多证据表明外星人是创造脸部的人。人们不能只是四处走动，说外星人导致面孔的发生，因为很少有证据表明外星人是由外星人造成的。加文还说：“这使他想起了爱达荷州蛇河平原上的中间布特特尔。”在第12段中。在第7段中，它还说毕竟没有外来动力。\\n\\n另外，有些人认为面孔只是一个自然的地形。我认为脸部是原因引起的，原因是天然地形，因为我发现了更多信息，即面部是由自然地形引起的。就像，在第7段中，迈克尔·马林（Michael Malin）和他的火星轨道摄像头（MOC）团队拍摄了一张照片，当图像首次出现在JPL网站上时，发现它是自然的地形。\\n\\n我认为，如果外星人真正创造了脸，那将有更多的证据或证明说外星人创造了面孔。因为有更多的证据说脸部是由自然地形创造的。如果有关于外星人创造的面孔的证据，而不是自然的地形，那么我不确定会做什么。\\n\\n最后，我发现自然地形所产生的脸比外星人创造的面孔更多的证据。有更多的人在谈论它不是由外星人创造的，也有人说有证据表明这张脸是由外星人创造的。但是，我不得不说，我会坚持更多关于自然灯笼创造的面孔的证据。

on Mars\\n\\nIn an article on \"Dispving to Mars\", people think that faces are created by aliens. In this article, I will tell you whether the aliens have created a face, or it is just a natural terrain. Why do people think that this face was created by aliens? Or is it just a natural terrain? What do you think of the faces created by aliens?\\n\\nNow that we have solved this problem, why do people think that faces are created by aliens? There are not many evidence that aliens are people who create faces. People can't just walk around, saying that aliens have caused the face, because there are few evidence that aliens are caused by alien people. Garvin also said, \"This reminds him of the middle Buttel on the Snake River Plain in the Edhata.\" In paragraph 12. In paragraph 7, it also said that there was no external motivation after all.\\n\\nIn addition, some people think that faces are just a natural terrain. I think the face is caused by the cause, because the natural terrain is found in more information, that is, the facialness is caused by the natural terrain. Just like, in the seventh paragraph, Michael Malin and his Mars rail camera (MOC) team took a photo. When the image appeared on the JPL website for the first time, it was found that it was a natural terrain.\\n\\nIn my opinion, if the aliens really created their faces, there will be more evidence or proof that aliens create their faces. Because there are more evidence that the face is created by natural terrain. If evidence of the faces created by aliens, not the natural terrain, then I am not sure what will do.\\n\\nFinally, I found that the faces generated by natural terrain had more evidence than the faces created by aliens. More people are talking about it by aliens, and some people say that there is evidence that the face is created by the aliens. However, I have to say that I will adhere to more evidence about the faces created by natural lanterns.\n",

They also do not have much confident to speak with lots of people or give a speech in front of many people, which makes someone who attends an everyday class with a lot of people to be experienced than a person who takes an online class. people with much experience in a lot of things do not always have fake people in their lives.\\n\\nPeople always think that taking an online class is very good, which is totally wrong. When taking online classes you do not get to know the people who are performing much better than you in class, but when you go to an everyday class in a school, you know the people who are better than you in different subjects. When you take an online class you do not get people who will help you solve your problems in much courses; for example, when you take an online class and you fail in a subject you would not know those who performed good in that subject, that means that you will not know how to study hard to perform good next time. Online students always find it difficult to study because, they do not see their mates in school learning which will also encourage them to that same thing. This means that taking an online classes will not be advisable for students.\\n\\nAlso when taking an online class, you do not get to interact with different kind of people through out the world. People who take an online class do not always have the confident to speak in public and do not always have lot of friends. Having friends is one of the important things in our life. When you have friends you share each others problems and solve it together. This means that when you take an online class you do not always have enough friends to speak to or to share your problems with. For instance,when you are given the opportunity to give a speech in front of a lot of people, you begin to shiver or start stammering because you are not use to speaking in public. but when a person who attends classes which involves a lot of individuals, they always have the confident not to only speak in front of their mates but to also speak to those who are much older than them without any fears.\\n\\nMoreover, people who always involve themselves in a video conference do not always know the people their dealing with in their business or do not always have much idea about their business meeting. When one is present at work place all the time, he or she runs the business smoothly without any misunderstanding with anybody. Again when having a business with someone on a video conference, you do not know if the person you are dealing with is a fraud a fraud or not. So people who do an online businesses always end up putting themselves into trouble. When one is always present at their business places, they always know the people who are hard working and can make the business go much further and those who are lazy. When you are always at your work place,you make your members to respect and adopt your policies.\\n\\nPeople who take online classes do not understand much better because, the teacher is not always around them when they need help with the topic that they not understand. But hen you are in an everyday school classes, when a teacher always teach and you do not understand you always know where to locate him to ask for help. Even when the teacher is not around, you can find different teachers who also teaches that subject and they will always find a solution to your problem. So students who attend an everyday classes perform much better than those who take an online classes.\\n\\nAll the above mentioned, which includes, it makes them interact with different people, find a lot of friends, get to know good people in a business, ask teachers for help when they have a problem really shows that taking an online class or a video conference is not really beneficial for an individual. Once all these measures are taken into consideration, people will see that going to an everyday class or making yourself present at a business meeting is more important to a person.                764                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              students who take an online classes do not have much benefits because, they feel lazy to study on their own, sometimes do not their assignments and also do not have people they will be compete with.

Once all these measures are taken into consideration, people will see that going to an everyday class or making yourself present at a business meeting is more important to a person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              参加在线课程的学生没有太大的好处，因为他们懒惰地自己学习，有时不做分配，也没有与他们竞争的人。他们也没有太多自信地与很多人交谈人或在许多人面前发表演讲，这使得与参加在线课程的人一起参加日常课程的人。假人一生。人们总是认为参加在线课程非常好，这是完全错误的。当在线课程时，您不会认识那些在课堂上表现更好的人，但是当您去上课时在学校的日常课程，您知道那些比不同学科更好的人。当您参加在线课程时，您将不会得到帮助您在许多课程中解决问题的人；例如，当您参加在线课程并且在主题上失败时，您将不知道那些在该主题上表现出色的人，这意味着您将不知道如何在下次进行努力学习。在线学生总是会发现很难学习是因为他们在学校学习中看不到他们的伴侣，这也会鼓励他们做同样的事情。这意味着参加在线课程对学生不建议。与世界各地的不同人在一起。参加在线课程的人并不总是有信心在公开场合讲话，并且并不总是有很多朋友。朋友你们彼此分享问题并解决问题。这意味着当您参加在线课程时，您并不总是有足够的朋友与您交谈或分享您的问题。例如，当您有机会发表演讲时在很多人面前，您开始发抖或开始结结巴巴，因为您不习惯在公共场合讲话。但是，当一个参加涉及很多个人的课程的人时，他们总是有信心不仅在同伴面前说话，而是与那些没有任何恐惧的人说话。在视频会议上自己并不总是认识他们在业务中与之打交道的人，或者并不总是对他们的商务会议有太多了解。当一个人一直在工作场所出现时，他或她在没有任何误解的情况下顺利地经营业务与任何人一起在视频会议上与某人开展业务时，您不知道与您打交道的人是否是欺诈行为。一个人总是在他们的营业场所，他们总是认识那些努力工作并且可以使业务进一步发展的人，而那些懒惰的人。当您始终在工作场所时，您会让您尊重和采用您的政策。参加在线课程的人不太了解，因为当老师需要他们不理解的主题时，老师并不总是在他们身边。但是，当您在日常的学校课程中，老师总是教书，而您不了解您总是知道在哪里可以找到他的帮助。参加日常课程的学生比参加在线课程的学生要好得多。上述所有提到的学生，包括他们与不同的人互动，找到很多朋友，认识企业中的好人，询问老师当他们遇到问题时提供帮助确实表明参加在线课程或视频会议对个人并不是真正有益的。一旦考虑所有这些措施，人们都会看到去EV关于一个人的班级或让自己在商务会议上出席对人更为重要。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Students participating in online courses are not much benefit, because they are lazy to study by themselves, sometimes do not allocate, and they are not competing with them. They did not have much confidence to talk to many people or give speeches in front of many people, which enabled those who participated in daily courses with those who participated in the online course. False people's life. People always think that participating in online courses is very good, which is completely wrong. When online courses, you don't know those who perform better in class, but when you go to the daily course in school when you go to class, you know those who are better than different disciplines. When you participate in the online course, you will not get someone who helps you solve the problem in many courses; for example, when you participate This means that you will not know how to study hard next time. Online students will always find it difficult to learn because they can't see their partners in school learning, which will also encourage them to do the same thing. This means that participation in online courses does not recommend students. Be with different people around the world. Those who participate in the online course are not always confident to speak in public, and there are not always many friends. Friends, you share problems with each other and solve the problem. This means that when you participate in the online course, you don't always have enough friends to talk to you or share your questions. For example, when you have the opportunity to make a speech, you start to tremble or start stutter because you are not used to speaking in public.However, when a person participating in many people involved in many people, they are always confident that they not only speak in front of their companions, but speak to those who have no fear. At the video conference, they do not always know those who deal with them in their business, or they do not always know much about their business conferences. When a person has always appeared at the workplace, when he or she runs the business smoothly without any misunderstanding, when you start a business with anyone at a video conference, you don’t know if the person who deal with you is fraud. Behavior. A person is always in their business place. They always know those who work hard and can make the business further, and those lazy people. When you are always in a workplace, you will let you respect and adopt your policy. Those who participate in the online course do not know much, because when the teacher needs the theme of them that they do not understand, the teacher does not always be with them. However, when you are in daily school courses, the teacher always teaches, and you don't know where you always know where to find his help. Students participating in daily courses are much better than those who participate in online courses. All the students mentioned above, including them interact with different people, find a lot of friends, know good people in the enterprise, and ask the teacher to provide help when they encounter problems. Essence Once all these measures are considered, people will see EV's class about a person or let themselves attend at a business conference.\n",
