Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.\\n\\nFirst, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what you're doing. Because you're defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they don't make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they're afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you're doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It's your life and you do what you think is right.\\n\\nSecond, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they're happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they're depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says \"Those who know God should love others, because God is love.\"\\n\\nNot being yourself will get you depressed because you don't do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don't want to do just to fit in, because they don't want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won't be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he's doing since it's his friends.\\n\\nLastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids don't like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says \" Honor your father and mother.\"\\n\\nIf you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you don't want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don't watch, and stand up for them, don't be afraid to stand up for someone because you're doing the right thing.\\n\\nSome may disagree with me and say that it's not that big of a deal, and it doesn't feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that it's a big accomplishment because nowadays it's really hard to become yourself.\\n\\nIn conclusion, It's hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and you're afraid to fight it back. That's why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.</td>\n",

In my case, Albert Schweitzer was right on his quote. Although many people say that there are better ways to influence others than just with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples, actually the best way to influence others is setting a good example on your own behavior because it shows that you were capable of doing it no matter how hard it was for you and yet you still did it and also you will inspire other people to do their own example based on your ideas.\\n\\nSome people say that there are better ways to influence others because than with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples. Meaning that you have to be someone important in order to influence others. They say that intelligence is another way to influence others because if you're not smart you won't make a good example for others to follow. In conclusion they say that you have to be a skilled and important person to have a huge influence on others.\\n\\nActually, the best way to influence other is not being someone important in society but setting a good example on your own behavior. It will show that that even though it was hard for you to do your example, in the end you still did it. That show that no matter who you are or where you come from as long as you have determination you will achieve your goals. Look at Barack Obama for example, he's a black man and yet he still managed to become president of the United States. That really had a huge impact in the black community and inspired many of them to work hard for their goals.\\n\\nAlso, you will inspire other people based on your own ideas. An article on New York Times shows that most of the people based their ideas on other people's examples, which means that if you continue working hard to achieve your goals you will appear on one of those articles and will inspire others. Think about it, wouldn't you like to hear that one person gave you credits because became successful because he read about your experience and he based his ideas on that experience of yours?\\n\\nIn conclusion, many people will say that in order to influence others you need to become somebody important, but you know what? That doesn't matter! As long as you have determination and great creativity you will achieve your goals and will inspire many people to follow their dreams no matter how much it will cost them. Like Albert Schweitzer said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.\" It doesn't matter what people say, the one that has the power to inspire others is you!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Many people disagree with the famous saying of Albert Schweitzer: \"Examples are not the main factor affecting others; this is the only thing.\" They think he means who did it, this is a role model. As far as I am concerned, Albert Schweitzer is just right in his offer. Although many people say that there are some better ways to influence others, not your own experience, because there are some interesting examples, in fact, the best way to affect others is to set a good role model on your behavior Because this shows that you can do this no matter how hard you work for you, but you still do this, and you will also stimulate others to make your own example according to your ideas.\\n\\nSome people say that there are better ways to influence others, because there are more interesting examples than your own experience, because of their own experience. This means that you must be an important person to affect others. They say that intelligence is another way to affect others, because if you are not smart, you will not follow others. In short, they said that you must be a skilled and important person in order to have a huge impact on others.\\n\\nIn fact, the best way to affect others is not to become an important person in society, but to establish an example of their own behavior. This will show that even if you are difficult to make an example, you will still do so. This shows that as long as you are determined, no matter who you are or where you come from, you can achieve your goals. For example, looking at Barack Obama, he is a black man, but he still trys to become the president of the United States. This does have a huge impact on the black community and inspire many people to work hard for their goals.\\n\\nIn addition, you will inspire others according to your own ideas. An article on the New York Times shows that most people think of their ideas based on others, which means that if you continue to work hard to achieve your goals, you will appear on one of the articles and will inspire others Essence Consider, do you want to hear a person for you because he has succeeded because he reads your experience and his idea is based on your experience?\\n\\nIn short, many people will say that you need to be an important person to affect others, but do you know? It's ok! As long as you are determined and great creativity, you will achieve your goals and stimulate many people to follow their dreams, no matter how much they spend.

They need to be really patience for example, when babies are trying to walk they fall many times but get up and they keep trying until they reach their goal which in this case is walk or, there have been many cases when people have car accidents and they lose the ability to walk that's something that does not stop them they keep trying even if take more than a year they don't give up because their goal is to be able to walk again, their goal is to be the person they used to be before they get in that car accident, and they just want to be able to keep doing all the stuff they used to do before all the tragedy happens.\\n\\nSecondly, everything depends in how positive people is because, if they have a negative mind and always act like their goal's is something impossible to come true their not going to accomplish nothing because people need to have the idea that they can make true everything they want, they don't have to be thinking in failure cause the more you think the more afraid you get to encourage yourself to make thing's happen and they have to try every day to improve and look for the resources available to success in life.\\n\\nFinally, they always need to keep in mind that there always would be a chance of failure and they have the right to be afraid but, that's something they need to live aside and they need to be focus on their goal,\\n\\nthey need to have the power to stop themselves whenever they want, and they have to be the ones to say to their self to stop when they think they already accomplish what they want but, they can't let people decide for them. Because sometimes people get jealous to see the other one's success in life and they try to guide people into failure.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there have been nothing that can't stop people to reach their goal's and success in life because everything is possible, people have to believe in them self and always be positive they always need to keep in mind that they are capable's of everything and they need to learn to not give up. In that way they would be able to do everything and be successful the key is always have and excellent attitude and be prepared for people to judge, and be prepared to failure and get up and make it see like their have been nothing wrong and keep going. They need to be positive in every movement they make and be positive in the way that everything is going to be exactly how the planned.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Do you think failure is the main goal of people, not losing enthusiasm? I agree that failure in the pursuit of success, because I think failure is the main key to people's goals because they need such an idea, that is, success after failure. What they want and how they want to succeed in life, in the end they must be failed and failed. They must be prepared to face failure. People need to have such an idea, that is, after failure The cause of this occurs, if some reasons are due to some reasons, they try to succeed, and they need to accept things and continue to try. They need for, for example, for the true patience, when the baby tries to walk, they have fallen many times, but they have been trying to reach the goal. This is walking, or in many cases, people have encountered a car accident, but they they have encountered a car accident, but they they encountered a car accident, but they were in a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident. The ability to lose the car can not stop them. Even if it takes more than a year, they do not give up because their goal is to walk again. Their goal is to become a car accident in the past. They just want to be able to be able to be able to be. Continue to do all the past before all tragedies.Second, everything depends on the positive person, because if they have a negative mind and always act like their goals, it is impossible to achieve anything.Thinking, because you think the more you are afraid that you will encourage yourself to achieve things, they must try to improve and find the resources in life every day.They always need to remember that there is always a chance to fail. They have the right to be afraid, but this is something they need to live. They need to focus on their goals.\\n\\nThey need the ability to stop themselves when needed, and they must be the one who says to themselves so that they can stop when they think they have completed what they want, but they cannot let people decide them to see that people see each other in life.In the success, they tried to guide people to fail.All in all, nothing cannot prevent people from achieving their goals and success, because everything is possible. People must believe in themselves and always maintain a positive attitude. They always need to keep in mind that they have the ability to learn not to give up.In this way, they will be able to do everything and achieve success, and they will always have a good attitude, make a good judgment for people, prepare to fail, get up and do this to see them wrong, and continue to move forward.They must be positive in every movement they do and become positive in all ways.</td>\n",

Then you'll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear.\\n\\nmost students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go.\\n\\nwhen your home your comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.                     3.5     3.5         3.0          3.0      4.0          3.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 我认为学生将从家里学习中受益，因为他们不必在清晨淋浴并在那里做头发。只上课可以帮助他们，因为在那里，他们将受到更多关注。他们会在家里很舒服。\\n\\n学校最困难的部分正在做好准备。您醒来去刷牙，去壁橱，看着你的衣服。在您认为选择了一件衣服后，您可以去看镜子，要么不喜欢它，要么看污渍。然后，您必须更改。通过在线课程，您可以穿任何衣服并待在家里，您不需要强调穿什么衣服。\\n\\n大多数学生通常在放学前洗澡。他们要么在睡觉之前就服用它，要么醒来。有些学生俩都闻起来很香。这导致他们确实错过了公共汽车，并且对那里的影响时间，因为他们上学迟到了。当您有在线课程时，您将不需要错过课程，因为您可以设置所有东西，然后去洗个澡，当您准备好出去时。\\n\\n当您的房屋舒适并注意时。然后，它具有更聪明的优势，甚至通过班上的同学通过那里。即使您尝试，公立学校也很困难。一些老师不知道如何以学生理解它的方式教它。这会导致学生失败，他们可能会重复课程。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I think students will benefit from learning at home because they don't have to shower in the morning and make their hair there. Only class can help them, because they will receive more attention there. They will be comfortable at home.\\n\\nThe most difficult part of the school is preparing. You wake up to brush your teeth, go to the closet, and look at your clothes. After you think you choose a dress, you can go to see the mirror, either you don't like it or look at the stains. Then you must change it. Through online courses, you can wear any clothes and stay at home. You don't need to emphasize what clothes you wear.\\n\\nMost students usually take a bath before school. They either take it before going to bed or wake up. Some students smell very fragrant. This caused them to miss the buses and affect the time there was because they were late in school. When you have an online course, you don't need to miss the course because you can set up everything and take a bath, when you are ready to go out.\\n\\nWhen your house is comfortable and pay attention. Then, it has a smarter advantage, and even through the classmates in the class. Even if you try, public schools are difficult. Some teachers do not know how to teach it in a way student understand it. This will cause students to fail, and they may repeat the curriculum.\n",

A\\n\\nproblem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok.\\n\\nFirst of all it can make you see different then the others. For example i remember that when i came to the United States i think that nothing was going to change me because i think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country and then i realist that wrong because a problem may change you but sometimes can not change the way it is, but i remember that i was really shy but i think that change a lot because sometimes my problems make me think that there is more thing that i never see in my life but i just need to see it from a different way and dont let nothing happened and ruing the change that i want to make because of just a problem. For example i think that nothing was going to change me and that i dont need to be shy anymore became i need to start seeing everything in a different ways because you can get mad at every one but you need to know what is going to happened after,\\n\\npeople may see you different but the only way that you know how to change is to do the best and don't let nothing or not body to change nothing about you. The way you want to change not one have that and can't do nothing about it because is your choice and your problems and you can decide what to do with it.\\n\\nsecond of all can help you to understand how things work. For instance my mom have a lot of problems but she have faith when she is around people, my mom is scare of high and i'm not scare of high i did not understand why my mos is scare of high and in not scare of high and every time i see my mom in a airplane it make me laugh because she is scare and is funny, but i see it from a different way and i like the high but also she have to understand that hoe things work in other people because it can no be the same as you. For example i think that my mom and me are different because we are and i have to understand that she does not like high and i need to understand that. to help someone to understand how things work you need to start to see how things work in that persons life.\\n\\nA problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand. Everyone has a different opinion and a different was to understand then others. everyone can see the different opinion and what other people think.       2.5     2.5         3.0          2.0      2.0          2.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              当问题是一个变化时，您必须让它在您身上尽力而为，无论发生什么都会改变您的主意。随着时间的流逝而改变。\\n\\n问题对您来说是一个改变，因为它可以使您看到与众不同，并帮助您了解如何倾斜。首先，它可以使您看到与其他人不同。例如，我记得当我来到美国时，我认为什么都不会改变我，因为我认为什么都不会改变我，因为我的国家与我的国家有所不同，然后我是错误的，因为问题可能会改变您，但有时无法改变它的方式，但我记得我记得我真的很害羞，但我认为这种变化很大我想因为一个问题而做。例如，我认为什么都不会改变我，我不再需要害羞了，我需要以不同的方式开始看到一切，因为您可以生气，但您需要知道之后会发生什么，，，，\\n\\n人们可能会看到您与众不同，但您知道如何改变的唯一途径就是做最好的事情，不要让您什么都不改变或不改变您的方式。什么都不是，因为您的选择和问题是您的选择，您可以决定如何处理它。第二，所有人都可以帮助您了解事情的工作方式。例如，我妈妈有很多问题，我妈妈很害怕，我并不感到恐惧，我不明白为什么我的MOS吓到高高，也不吓到高高，每次我在飞机上看到妈妈时，我都会发笑，因为她很恐惧而且很有趣，但是我从不同的方式看到它，我喜欢高高，但她也必须了解，hoe的事物在别人中起作用，因为它与您不一样。例如，我认为我和我的妈妈和我是与众不同，因为我们和我必须了解她不喜欢高高，我需要理解这一点。为了帮助某人了解事物的工作方式，您需要开始了解该人生活中的工作方式。一个问题对您来说是一个改变，可以使您与众不同并帮助您理解。每个人都有不同的看法当时理解其他人。每个人都可以看到不同的观点以及其他人的想法。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  When the problem is a change, you must let it do your best, no matter what happens, you will change your idea.Change over time.\\n\\nThe problem is a change for you, because it can make you different and help you understand how to tilt.First, it can make you see different from others.For example, when I remember when I came to the United States, I thought nothing would change me, because I thought nothing would change me, because my country was different from my country, and then I was wrong because the problemIt may change you, but sometimes it can't change its way, but I remember I remember that I was really shy, but I think this kind of change is very big. I want to do it because of a problem.For example, I think nothing will change me. I no longer need to be shy. I need to start everything in different ways, because you can be angry, but you need to know what will happen after you know ,,,,,,,,,,,\\n\\nPeople may see that you are different, but you know how to change the only way to do the best thing. Don't let you not change or change your way. Nothing is, because your choice and problem are your choice, you can decide how to deal with it. Second, everyone can help you understand the way of work. For example, my mother has a lot of problems. My mother is very scared. I am not afraid. I don’t understand why my MOS scares high and doesn’t scare high. Every time I see my mother on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am on the plane, I am when I see my mother, I am on the plane, I am on the plane. They will laugh because she is scared and interesting, but I see it from different ways. I like high, but she must also understand that HOE's things work among others because it is different from you. For example, I think my mother and I are different, because we and I must understand that she doesn't like high, I need to understand this.In order to help someone understand the work of things, you need to start understanding the way of work in the person's life.One problem is a change for you, which can be different and help you understand.Everyone has different views at the time to understand others at the time.Everyone can see different views and other people's ideas.\n",

Because many students have a C average. So that means that they cant go out for sports or other activities they want to do bad. That's like taking everything they have. What if kids want to become good at something, but now they cant because of that school policy. If they have a C average they should still be able to go out for sports or activities. A C average isn't that bad, its higher then a D average. If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldn't do sports or activities. If they have a D average in school for not working hard, that's means that they in ain't going to try hard. If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities. What if all the good people in sports have a C average in school, that means that they cant play and were going to lose every game we have. That's a good policy to get grade's up but don't take away something they care about. Everyone should be able to go out for sports if they want to. If the school policy happens, schools going to be boarding now, because now students cant go out for sports or other activities. The students that are doing good in school should feel good about themselves but we shouldn't take the other students away from the others ones. If we do this policy student will try to raised their grade but if they cant what happens they them. Should they just be out of it and think that schools boarding. If they do this its like taking away their video games. All I'm saying is that they have the right to go out for sports or activities.       3.0     3.5         3.0          3.0      3.0          2.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        亲爱的，校长\\n\\n如果您更改学校的政策，那就是让B级平均值不公平。因为许多学生的平均水平。因此，这意味着他们不能参加运动或其他想做糟糕的活动。这就像拿走他们拥有的一切。如果孩子们想变得擅长某事，但是现在他们不能因为学校政策而无法做到什么。如果他们的平均值，他们仍然应该能够参加运动或活动。 C平均值还不错，其平均值较高。如果学校警察是平均水平较低的情况，他们不应该进行运动或活动。如果他们在学校中没有努力工作，那意味着他们不会努力。如果他们有平均水平，并且在那里努力，他们应该能够参加运动或活动。如果体育运动中的所有好人在学校的平均水平上都有C的平均水平，那意味着他们不能玩，并且将失去我们的每场比赛。这是一项很好的政策，可以使Grade升级，但不要带走他们关心的东西。每个人都应该可以参加运动。如果发生学校政策，学校将现在登机，因为现在学生不能外出体育或其他活动。在学校做得好的学生应该对自己感觉良好，但我们不应该把其他学生带离其他学生。如果我们这样做，这位政策学生将尝试提高他们的成绩，但是如果他们不可能发生的事情。他们应该只是摆脱它并认为学校登机。如果他们这样做，就像夺走他们的视频游戏一样。我要说的是，他们有权参加运动或活动。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Dear, principal\\n\\nIf you change the school's policy, it is to make the B -level average unfair. Because of the average level of many students. Therefore, this means that they cannot participate in sports or other activities to do bad activities. It's like taking away everything they have. If children want to become good at something, but now they cannot do anything because of school policies. If their average, they should still be able to participate in sports or activities. The average value of C is not bad, and its average is high. If the school police are low average, they should not exercise or move. If they do not work hard in school, it means that they will not work hard. If they have the average level and work there, they should be able to participate in sports or activities. If all good people in sports have the average level of C at the school, it means that they cannot play and will lose every game of us. This is a good policy that allows Grade to upgrade, but do not take away what they care about. Everyone should be able to participate in sports. If the school policy occurs, the school will board the plane now because students cannot go out of sports or other activities. Students who do well in school should feel good about ourselves, but we should not bring other students away from other students. If we do this, this policy student will try to improve their achievements, but if they cannot happen. They should just get rid of it and think of the school boarding. If they do this, they are like taking their video games. What I want to say is that they have the right to participate in sports or activities.\n",

Some people follow others, therefore, they don't make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they're afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you're doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It's your life and you do what you think is right.\\n\\nSecond, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they're happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they're depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says \"Those who know God should love others, because God is love.\"\\n\\nNot being yourself will get you depressed because you don't do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don't want to do just to fit in, because they don't want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won't be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he's doing since it's his friends.\\n\\nLastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids don't like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says \" Honor your father and mother.\"\\n\\nIf you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you don't want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don't watch, and stand up for them, don't be afraid to stand up for someone because you're doing the right thing.\\n\\nSome may disagree with me and say that it's not that big of a deal, and it doesn't feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that it's a big accomplishment because nowadays it's really hard to become yourself.\\n\\nIn conclusion, It's hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and you're afraid to fight it back. That's why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.        4.5     4.5         4.5          4.5      4.0          5.0  人生中最好的时光是当您成为自己时。我同意，最大的成就是当您成为一个不断努力使自己做其他事情的世界中，因为您做出自己的选择，您变得更加快乐，并且您尊重别人。首先，您自己做出自己的选择。要做好自己的选择，这意味着您应该能够做出自己的选择，而不是害羞或害怕自己在做什么。因为您可以通过做那些事情来定义自己您想要。有些人跟随他人，因此，他们不会做出自己的选择。人们害怕做出自己的选择，因为他们不想被拒绝或错。在这个世界上，大多数青少年行为和跟随坚强和欺负的人。他们跟随他们并做出相同的选择的原因是因为他们担心他们会被殴打并被排除在外。当我来到美国时，我曾经是跟随其他人，因为我认为它们很棒。但是e Day，我知道我走错了路，我离开了他们。做出自己的选择会让您快乐，因为您可以做自己喜欢的事情和想做的事情。很难做出自己的选择，但是有一天您将不得不做出自己的选择。更容易让您更容易害怕自己在做什么以及其他人如何看待它，因为归根结底，这是您的生活，您会做自己的想法。成为自己的快乐，因为您做出自己的选择，承担责任，并做任何让您快乐的事情。此外，有些人的行为就像他们不自我，但事实上，他们对内心感到沮丧。做你自己会让你更加快乐，因为你觉得自己取得了很大的成就。此外，有些宗教的孩子会爱上每个人。让您沮丧，因为您不做您想做的一切，BU你会做别人想做的事，因为你想适应。来自另一个国家的一些孩子会做他们不想适应的事情，因为他们不想孤独。害怕他们不会快乐，因为他们会因为自己的自己而失去很多朋友，但是他们必须知道那些人应该在那里为他们服务，因为他是他的朋友，他们的工作。他们尊重你。有些青少年喜欢取笑别人，不听他们说的话，他们喜欢殴打孩子。还有一些孩子不喜欢不听父母的话，这也不尊重。圣经说”敬拜你的父母。 ，有些人是不尊重的，因为他们从未受到尊重。要尊重的重要事情是，听别人说的话，为他们站起来，与他们成为朋友，做所有这些都会赢得您的尊重，您会有好朋友。此外，如果您看到某人欺负孩子不要看，就为他们站起来，不要害怕为某人站起来，因为您正在做正确的事，有些人可能会不同意我说这并不是一件大事，也不是一项巨大的成就。请尊重，我同意这是一项巨大的成就，因为如今确实很难成为自己。总而言之，在这个世界上很难成为自己，因为其他人则将这种机会退缩，而您害怕反击它。这就是为什么我同意在一个不断努力使您成为其他事物的世界中成为自己的最大成就。  The best time in life is when you become yourself.I agree that the biggest achievement is when you become a world that keeps working hard to make yourself other things, because you make your own choice, you become happier and you respect others.First, you make your own choice.To make your own choice, this means that you should be able to make your own choice, not shy or afraid of what you are doing.Because you can define yourself by doing those things.Some people follow others, so they will not make their own choices.People are afraid of making their own choices because they don't want to be rejected or wrong.In this world, most young people behavior and people who follow strong and bullying.The reason they followed them and made the same choice was because they were worried that they would be beaten and excluded.When I came to the United States, I used to follow the others because I think they are great.But e day, I know I went the wrong way, and I left them.Making your own choice will make you happy, because you can do what you like and what you want to do. It is difficult to make your own choice, but one day you will have to make your own choice. It is easier to make you more afraid of what you are doing and how others think of it, because in the final analysis, this is your life, and you will do your own ideas. Be your own happiness, because you make your own choice, take responsibility, and do anything to make you happy. In addition, some people's behavior is like they are not themselves, but in fact, they are frustrated by their hearts. Doing you yourself will make you happier, because you feel that you have made great achievements. In addition, some religious children will fall in love with everyone. Make you frustrated, because you don't do everything you want to do, Bu You will do what others want to do because you want to adapt. Some children from another country do things they don't want to adapt because they don't want to be alone. Fear that they will not be happy because they will lose many friends because of themselves, but they must know that those people should serve them because he is his friend and their job. They respect you.Some teenagers like to make fun of others. They don't listen to what they say, they like to beat their children.There are also some children who do not like to listen to their parents, and they do not respect.The Bible says \"worship your parents. Some people are disrespectful because they have never been respected. The important thing to respect is to listen to what others say, stand up for them, become friends with them, and do all of them.If you win your respect, you will have a good friend. In addition, if you see someone bullying the child, don't watch it, don't be afraid to stand up for someone, because you are doing the right thing, some people may be likelyI don't agree with me to say that this is not a big deal, nor is it a huge achievement. Please respect, I agree that this is a huge achievement, because it is really difficult to become yourself now.Because others have shrunk this opportunity, and you are afraid of fighting against it. This is why I agree with a world that constantly strives to make you the biggest achievement in other things.\n",

               I believe using cellphones in class for education us only is good/bad idea for students.\\n\\nI believe some students learn easer on technolegy then paper ad pencil, but i also believe cellphone could be use for bad use such as students using for games and apps, texting etc ,\\n\\nI believe cellphones could drop grades. i've been through it all and seen it all, im a student myself and sometimes when our teachers allowes us to use our cellphones i take the chance to look through my texts and i would see my classmates do the same, but then we have moments where we reallly need to serach up information or our teacher would love to play an online game then its really useful .\\n\\nThere cant be a right or wrong answer to this but there could be an amazing arugment to this issue.\\n\\nI believe using technolgy could save trees and our nature enviorment, using technolgy could stop schools and the goverment fro cutting down tress for papers and allow us to use our

我相信在我们的教育中使用手机对我们来说是好主意/坏主意。\\n\\n我相信有些学生在技术上学习比纸铅笔更轻松，但我也认为手机可能用于不良使用，例如学生使用游戏和应用程序，发短信等\\n\\n我相信手机可以降低成绩。我已经经历了所有的事情，看到了所有这些，我本人是一个学生，有时候，当我们的老师允许我们使用手机时，我会抓住机会浏览我的文字，我会看到我的同学也一样，但是我们有我们真正需要掌握信息的时刻，或者我们的老师很想玩在线游戏，然后确实有用。\\n\\n对此没有一个对或错误的答案，但是这个问题可能会有惊人的侵害。\\n\\n我相信使用技术可以节省树木和我们的自然设想，使用技术可以阻止学校和政府通过削减论文的诉讼，并允许我们使用手机。我们从不

pencils, but I also think that mobile phones may be used in bad use, such as students using games and applications, sending text messages, etc.\\n\\nI believe that mobile phones can reduce their grades.I have experienced everything and saw all these. I am a student. Sometimes, when our teacher allows us to use mobile phones, I will seize the opportunity to browse my text. I will see my classmates tooThe same, but we have the moment we really need to master information, or our teachers want to play online games, and then it is really useful.\\n\\nThere is no right or wrong answer to this, but this question may have amazing infringement.\\n\\nI believe that using technology can save trees and our natural ideas. Using technology can prevent schools and the government from cutting lawsuits from papers and allowing us to use mobile phones.We never\n",

Working with a group allows students to work more efficiently. Personally and due to the facts, I would prefer to work with a group because working with other is more beneficial for students.\\n\\nFirstly. Most students are required to do many proyects during each marking period which is to much for each student, and specially when there is a big proyect for each class that worth 10% of the period's grade, but working with a group the proyect might be diveded to each person in the group, and share between them. Each student have different and unique qualities that can be helpful to do do certain parts of proyects that for other can be difficult to do.\\n\\nSecondly. Working with a group might be also seen as opportunity for student of gaining values of cooperation which is important to have due to many companies assign jobs to two or more people to realize them because of the different knowledges they can provide to each other. Companies usually use the phrase:\\n\\n\"Work as a team\"\\n\\nto make their productivity more efficiently. Teachers should see this as way of helping students to get expiriences of working as team, and also that way, we as students would get knowledge of others.\\n\\nBy allowing students to work with group teacher might be helping student to get more confident about their due to the fact that students can disscuss betweend eache other the topics and loook forward the best way of doing them. Schools are allowing students to stay after school which is perfectly fine for those students that are not able to go to a house of one the members of the group. A group might be also helpful for those students that are having issues turning their work on time because; now, they can get be supported by other and be more productive.\\n\\nTo conclude, No students should be in the position of having a big proyect with no enough time without the opportunity of work with a groups. Many companies are assigning jobs to be done by more than one person, they know that a team works more efficiently than one person, and teachers should do the same in their classes to help students to get their grades up, and also to be productive on turning work in. Working with a group should be allowed for students during classes to improve their qualities of coorperation and to have different points of view to do the best for subject.       4.0     4.0         4.0          4.0      3.5          3.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               独自工作，学生不必与其他人争论他们的Proyect，而必须与他们不认识的人一起工作；但是，大多数学生更喜欢作为一个小组工作，因为学生能够跳水，分享想法和互相帮助。与小组合作可以使学生更有效地工作。就个人而言，由于事实，我更喜欢与一个小组合作，因为与其他人合作对学生更有益。\\n\\n首先。大多数学生都必须在每个标记期间进行许多PROYECT，这对每个学生来说都是很多，特别是当每个班级都有一个值得该时期成绩10％的班级时，但是与一个小组合作，Proyect可能会被潜水给小组中的每个人，并在他们之间分享。每个学生都有不同和独特的素质，可以帮助做某些部分的Proyect，而对于其他部件可能很难做到。\\n\\n第二。与一个小组合作也可能被视为学生获得合作价值观的机会，因为许多公司将工作分配给两个或更多人来实现他们，这对于彼此提供了不同的知识，这一点很重要。公司通常使用该短语：\\n\\n“团队合作”\\n\\n使其生产率更有效。老师应该将此视为帮助学生获得团队工作的到期，而我们作为学生将了解他人的知识。\\n\\n通过允许学生与小组老师一起工作，可能会帮助学生对自己的信心更加自信，这是因为学生可以互相讨论，并将其转发为最好的方法。学校允许学生在放学后留下来，这对那些无法去小组成员的房子的学生来说是完全满意的。一个小组可能对那些在按时扭转工作的学生也可能会有所帮助，因为；现在，他们可以得到他人的支持，并提高生产力。\\n\\n总而言之，没有学生在没有足够的机会的情况下，没有足够的时间才能与团体一起工作。许多公司正在为多个人分配工作要完成的工作，他们知道一个团队的工作效率比一个人更有效，老师应该在课堂上做同样的工作，以帮助学生提高成绩，并提高成果上课。应该在课堂上与一个小组一起工作，以提高他们的协调素质，并具有不同的观点，以尽最大努力为主题。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            To work alone, students do not have to argue with others their proyect, but must work with those they do not know; however, most students prefer to work as a group because students can dive, share their ideas and help each other. Cooperation with groups can make students work more effectively. Personally, because of facts, I prefer to cooperate with a group because cooperation with others is more beneficial to students.\\n\\nfirst. Most students must perform many proYECTs during each tag, which is a lot for each student, especially when each class has a class that is worth 10 % of the scores during this period, but cooperates with a group, but cooperates with a group. ProYECT may be diving to everyone in the group and shared between them. Each student has different and unique qualities, which can help do some parts of Proyect, and it is difficult to do for other components.\\n\\nsecond. Cooperation with a group may also be regarded as the opportunity to gain cooperation values, because many companies allocate their jobs to two or more people to realize them, which provides different knowledge for each other, which is important. The company usually uses this phrase:\\n\\n\"teamwork\"\\n\\nMake its productivity more effective. Teachers should consider this as helping students get the expiration of team work, and we will understand the knowledge of others as students.\\n\\nBy allowing students to work with group teachers, they may help students be more confident in their confidence in themselves. This is because students can discuss each other and forward them into the best way. The school allows students to stay after school, which is completely satisfied with those students who cannot go to the house members of the group. A group may also help those students who are reversing on time, because now, they can get the support of others and improve productivity.\\n\\nAll in all, without enough students without enough opportunities, there is no enough time to work with the group. Many companies are working for multiple individuals to allocate work. They know that the work efficiency of a team is more effective than one person. Teachers should do the same job in the classroom to help students improve their achievements and improve their results. It is necessary to work with a group in class to improve their coordinated quality and have different views, with the theme of the best efforts.\n",

If your still stuck on what it even means like I was in the first few minutes of seeing that, It means that in every challenge you see in life there is always a way to try your best and get through that challlenge, dispite what your mind tells you because your mind is your biggest enemy you will ever face. I dont particularly agree with that quote jsut because in certain problems even if you try your best you will still fail or if you just dont want to do the problem or other people around you dont then you most likley fail to. What im trying to get at to this quote is that instead of being \"For every problem there is a chance for you to do your best\" it should be \"For every problem or challenge there is always a way to get thorugh it\". Here is a few examples: If your dying from old age and your deadline is going to be this week. Then just die you get around the challlenge by dying because in most relgions there is something called heaven so you can die and go to heaven. Another example: Facing a hard question, just guess! You'll have a 1/4th chance of getting it right and if you just guess it would be bettter then sitting on the problem for 20 minutes.        2.5     3.0         3.0          3.0      3.5          3.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         我对那句话的看法是，“一个问题是您尽力而为”的机会是，您不能在每个问题上尽力而为。如果您仍然坚持到达的意思，就像我在最初的几分钟内看到的那样，这意味着在您生活中看到的每一个挑战中，总会有一种方法可以尽力而为，并通过这种挑战，分配您的思想告诉您，因为您的思想是您将面对的最大敌人。我不特别同意这句话JSUT，因为在某些问题中，即使您尽力而为，您仍然会失败，或者如果您只是不想遇到问题或周围的其他人，那么您最喜欢的是。即时通讯试图获得这句话的是，与其成为“对于每个问题，您都有机会尽力而为”应该是“对于每个问题或挑战，总会有一种方法来获取Thorugh It”。这里有几个例子：如果您从老年而死，您的截止日期将是本周。然后死了，你死了，因为在大多数关系中，都有所谓的天堂，所以你可以死去去天堂。另一个例子：面对一个棘手的问题，只需猜猜！您将有第1/4的机会正确，如果您只是猜测这将是列出的，然后坐在问题上20分钟。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           My opinion on that sentence is that the opportunity to \"one question is your best\" is that you can't do your best on every issue. If you still insist on arriving, as I saw in the first few minutes, this means that in every challenge you see in your life, there will always be a way to do your best, and through this Challenge, allocating your thoughts tell you, because your thoughts are the biggest enemies you will face. I don't specifically agree with this sentence JSUT, because in some issues, even if you do your best, you will still fail, or if you just don't want to encounter a problem or other people around you, then your favorite is. Instant communication trying to get this sentence is that instead of becoming \"you have the opportunity to do your best for every problem\" should be \"there will always be a way to get Thorough IT for every problem or challenge.\" There are several examples here: if you die from the elderly, your deadline will be this week. Then you die, you die, because in most relationships, there are so -called paradise, so you can go to heaven. Another example: Faced with a difficult problem, just guess! You will have the 1/4 opportunity correctly, if you just guess that this will be listed, and then sit on the problem for 20 minutes.\n",

In my case, Albert Schweitzer was right on his quote. Although many people say that there are better ways to influence others than just with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples, actually the best way to influence others is setting a good example on your own behavior because it shows that you were capable of doing it no matter how hard it was for you and yet you still did it and also you will inspire other people to do their own example based on your ideas.\\n\\nSome people say that there are better ways to influence others because than with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples. Meaning that you have to be someone important in order to influence others. They say that intelligence is another way to influence others because if you're not smart you won't make a good example for others to follow. In conclusion they say that you have to be a skilled and important person to have a huge influence on others.\\n\\nActually, the best way to influence other is not being someone important in society but setting a good example on your own behavior. It will show that that even though it was hard for you to do your example, in the end you still did it. That show that no matter who you are or where you come from as long as you have determination you will achieve your goals. Look at Barack Obama for example, he's a black man and yet he still managed to become president of the United States. That really had a huge impact in the black community and inspired many of them to work hard for their goals.\\n\\nAlso, you will inspire other people based on your own ideas. An article on New York Times shows that most of the people based their ideas on other people's examples, which means that if you continue working hard to achieve your goals you will appear on one of those articles and will inspire others. Think about it, wouldn't you like to hear that one person gave you credits because became successful because he read about your experience and he based his ideas on that experience of yours?\\n\\nIn conclusion, many people will say that in order to influence others you need to become somebody important, but you know what? That doesn't matter! As long as you have determination and great creativity you will achieve your goals and will inspire many people to follow their dreams no matter how much it will cost them. Like Albert Schweitzer said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.\" It doesn't matter what people say, the one that has the power to inspire others is you!        4.0     4.5         4.5          4.0      4.5          4.5                                                                                                                  许多人不同意阿尔伯特·施韦特策（Albert Schweitzer）的名言：“例子不是影响他人的主要因素；这是唯一的事情。”他们认为他的意思是谁做到了，这是一个榜样。就我而言，阿尔伯特·施韦特策（Albert Schweitzer）在他的报价上正好。尽管许多人说，有一些更好的方法来影响他人，而不是您自己的经历，因为有一些有趣的例子，实际上，影响他人的最佳方法是在您的行为上树立一个很好的榜样，因为这表明您是无论您对您有多努力，都能做到这一点，但您仍然这样做，您也会激发其他人根据您的想法做自己的榜样。\\n\\n有人说，有更好的方法来影响他人，因为比您自己的经验，有更多有趣的例子，因为有自己的经验。这意味着您必须成为一个重要的人才能影响他人。他们说智力是影响他人的另一种方式，因为如果您不聪明，就不会为他人效仿。总之，他们说您必须成为一个熟练和重要的人，才能对他人产生巨大影响。\\n\\n实际上，影响他人的最佳方法不是在社会上成为一个重要的人，而是树立自己的行为榜样。这将表明，即使您很难做一个榜样，最终您仍然会这样做。这表明，只要您有决心，无论您是谁或来自哪里，您都可以实现自己的目标。例如，看巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama），他是一个黑人，但他仍然设法成为美国总统。这确实对黑人社区产生了巨大影响，并激发了许多人为自己的目标努力。\\n\\n另外，您将根据自己的想法激发其他人。关于《纽约时报》的一篇文章表明，大多数人将他们的想法基于他人的例子，这意味着，如果您继续努力实现自己的目标，您将出现在其中一篇文章上，并会激发他人。考虑一下，您是否想听到一个人给您学分，因为他已经成功了，因为他读了您的经历，并且他的想法基于您的经历？\\n\\n总之，许多人会说，要影响他人，您需要成为一个重要的人，但是您知道吗？没关系！只要您有决心和伟大的创造力，您就会实现自己的目标，并激发许多人跟随他们的梦想，无论他们将花费多少。就像阿尔伯特·施韦特策（Albert Schweitzer）所说的那样：“例子不是影响他人的主要事情；这是唯一的事情。”人们说什么都没关系，有能力激发他人的能力是您！                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Many people disagree with the famous saying of Albert Schweitzer: \"Examples are not the main factor affecting others; this is the only thing.\" They think he means who did it, this is a role model. As far as I am concerned, Albert Schweitzer is just right in his offer. Although many people say that there are some better ways to influence others, not your own experience, because there are some interesting examples, in fact, the best way to affect others is to set a good role model on your behavior Because this shows that you can do this no matter how hard you work for you, but you still do this, and you will also stimulate others to make your own example according to your ideas.\\n\\nSome people say that there are better ways to influence others, because there are more interesting examples than your own experience, because of their own experience. This means that you must be an important person to affect others. They say that intelligence is another way to affect others, because if you are not smart, you will not follow others. In short, they said that you must be a skilled and important person in order to have a huge impact on others.\\n\\nIn fact, the best way to affect others is not to become an important person in society, but to establish an example of their own behavior. This will show that even if you are difficult to make an example, you will still do so. This shows that as long as you are determined, no matter who you are or where you come from, you can achieve your goals. For example, looking at Barack Obama, he is a black man, but he still trys to become the president of the United States. This does have a huge impact on the black community and inspire many people to work hard for their goals.\\n\\nIn addition, you will inspire others according to your own ideas. An article on the New York Times shows that most people think of their ideas based on others, which means that if you continue to work hard to achieve your goals, you will appear on one of the articles and will inspire others Essence Consider, do you want to hear a person for you because he has succeeded because he reads your experience and his idea is based on your experience?\\n\\nIn short, many people will say that you need to be an important person to affect others, but do you know? It's ok! As long as you are determined and great creativity, you will achieve your goals and stimulate many people to follow their dreams, no matter how much they spend. As Albert Schweitzer said: \"Example is not the main thing that affects others; this is the only thing.\" People say nothing, and the ability to stimulate others is you!\n",

They need to be really patience for example, when babies are trying to walk they fall many times but get up and they keep trying until they reach their goal which in this case is walk or, there have been many cases when people have car accidents and they lose the ability to walk that's something that does not stop them they keep trying even if take more than a year they don't give up because their goal is to be able to walk again, their goal is to be the person they used to be before they get in that car accident, and they just want to be able to keep doing all the stuff they used to do before all the tragedy happens.\\n\\nSecondly, everything depends in how positive people is because, if they have a negative mind and always act like their goal's is something impossible to come true their not going to accomplish nothing because people need to have the idea that they can make true everything they want, they don't have to be thinking in failure cause the more you think the more afraid you get to encourage yourself to make thing's happen and they have to try every day to improve and look for the resources available to success in life.\\n\\nFinally, they always need to keep in mind that there always would be a chance of failure and they have the right to be afraid but, that's something they need to live aside and they need to be focus on their goal,\\n\\nthey need to have the power to stop themselves whenever they want, and they have to be the ones to say to their self to stop when they think they already accomplish what they want but, they can't let people decide for them. Because sometimes people get jealous to see the other one's success in life and they try to guide people into failure.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there have been nothing that can't stop people to reach their goal's and success in life because everything is possible, people have to believe in them self and always be positive they always need to keep in mind that they are capable's of everything and they need to learn to not give up. In that way they would be able to do everything and be successful the key is always have and excellent attitude and be prepared for people to judge, and be prepared to failure and get up and make it see like their have been nothing wrong and keep going. They need to be positive in every movement they make and be positive in the way that everything is going to be exactly how the planned.       3.5     2.5         3.5          3.0      3.0          3.5                                                                                                                                                    您是否认为失败是人们的主要目标，而不是失去热情？我同意失败在追求成功中的重要作用，因为，我认为失败是人们达到的主要关键他们的目标是因为他们需要有这样的想法，即在失败之后取得成功，其次，他们需要保持积极，并牢记自己想要的东西以及他们想要如何在生活中取得成功，最后他们必须为失败，失败，他们必须准备面对失败，人们需要有这样的想法，即失败后成功，因为一切都是出于某种原因而发生的，如果某些原因出于某些原因出现问题时，他们试图取得成功，他们需要接受事物并继续尝试。他们需要例如，为了真正的耐心，当婴儿试图走路时，他们跌倒了很多次，但他们一直在尝试直到他们达到目标，这就是步行，或者，有很多情况下，人们遇到了车祸，而他们却失去了汽车走路的能力并不能阻止他们，即使花了超过一年，他们不放弃，因为他们的目标是能够再次行走，他们的目标是成为以前的人他们发生了那次车祸，他们只想能够在所有悲剧发生之前继续做所有过去所做的事情。其次，一切都取决于积极的人，因为，如果他们有消极的头脑，并且总是像他们的目标一样行事，那是不可能实现的，他们什么也不会做任何事情，他们不必在失败中思考，因为您认为越害怕您会鼓励自己实现事物，他们必须每天尝试改善并寻找生活中成功的资源。他们总是需要记住，总是有失败的机会，他们有权害怕，但是，这是他们需要生活的事情，他们需要专注于自己的目标，\\n\\n他们需要有能力在任何需要时停止自己，并且必须是对自己说的人，以便在他们认为已经完成自己想要的事情时停下来，但是他们不能让人们为他们决定人们嫉妒看到对方在生活中的成功，他们试图引导人们失败。总而言之，没有什么不能阻止人们实现自己的目标和成功，因为一切皆有可能，人们必须相信自己，并且始终保持积极的态度，他们总是需要牢记，他们的一切都有能力他们需要学会不放弃。这样，他们将能够做一切并取得成功的钥匙永远具有和良好的态度，并为人们做好判断，并准备失败并起床并做到这一点看到他们没有错，并且继续前进。他们在他们所做的每一个运动中都必须保持积极，并以一切的方式变得积极。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Do you think failure is the main goal of people, not losing enthusiasm? I agree that failure in the pursuit of success, because I think failure is the main key to people's goals because they need such an idea, that is, success after failure. What they want and how they want to succeed in life, in the end they must be failed and failed. They must be prepared to face failure. People need to have such an idea, that is, after failure The cause of this occurs, if some reasons are due to some reasons, they try to succeed, and they need to accept things and continue to try. They need for, for example, for the true patience, when the baby tries to walk, they have fallen many times, but they have been trying to reach the goal. This is walking, or in many cases, people have encountered a car accident, but they they have encountered a car accident, but they they encountered a car accident, but they were in a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident, but they had a car accident. The ability to lose the car can not stop them. Even if it takes more than a year, they do not give up because their goal is to walk again. Their goal is to become a car accident in the past. They just want to be able to be able to be able to be. Continue to do all the past before all tragedies.Second, everything depends on the positive person, because if they have a negative mind and always act like their goals, it is impossible to achieve anything.Thinking, because you think the more you are afraid that you will encourage yourself to achieve things, they must try to improve and find the resources in life every day.They always need to remember that there is always a chance to fail. They have the right to be afraid, but this is something they need to live. They need to focus on their goals.\\n\\nThey need the ability to stop themselves when needed, and they must be the one who says to themselves so that they can stop when they think they have completed what they want, but they cannot let people decide them to see that people see each other in life.In the success, they tried to guide people to fail.All in all, nothing cannot prevent people from achieving their goals and success, because everything is possible. People must believe in themselves and always maintain a positive attitude. They always need to keep in mind that they have the ability to learn not to give up.In this way, they will be able to do everything and achieve success, and they will always have a good attitude, make a good judgment for people, prepare to fail, get up and do this to see them wrong, and continue to move forward.They must be positive in every movement they do and become positive in all ways.\n",
