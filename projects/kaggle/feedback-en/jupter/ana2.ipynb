       "      <td>Many people are kind and do parts in helping others , what they don't know is , the act of kindness either received from or given to someone has a big impact no matter how small or big . Reasons an act of kindness can really benefit someone are , the person might have a better day just because of your kindness , the person might learn from your act of kindness and lastly , a good act of kindness can come back to you from the person who you helped .\\n\\nThe first reason of how kindness can impact a person is , the person whom you helped might have had a bad day or , you never know what someone is going through , they could have a hard life and are hiding it . The person who received the act of kindness might have bad a bad day or life , your kindness could have made that person feel so much better and worthy. Some people don't often receive kindness , you might have put a big smile on their face or , made their day much better . You can be seen as a person with good characters and manners , people can always depend on you if you are a kind person and do a lot to help make someone feel better with words or actions everyday , most people would appreciate you if you did almost anything to help them or make them smile because again , you never know what someone is going through . For example , I partnered up with a girl in our math class , she was crying for some reason and nobody wanted to be her partner , when I told her if she can be my partner , she said yes and sounded really happy when I said . I , of course told her what was wrong , she told me she was going through a lot at home and nobody wanted to be her friend in school , I was devastated to hear that . I told her she can be my friend and for the rest of the day she smiled and laughed .\\n\\nThe second reason any act of kindness , big or small , can impact a person is , the person receiving the kindness can learn from you and make themselves a better character too , you can influence a person with how you act , if you act kind and generous and , make good choices , someone is gonna learn from your words and actions . Same with if your a person who is just rude and makes bad decisions , someone else , will learn from your actions . Many people tend to learn from people in their environment , especially young people , so if a young person sees you offering a kind act of helping to either them or someone else , they can learn from your actions and see you as a big role model , people should always make good decisions for many reasons one being that young people can benefit from your choices and will always look up to you for being the person to guide them through life , many people make bad decisions around children but if you do an act of kindness , to them or someone else , young kids will automatically learn from you . For example , one day me and my little sister were in the park , playing with our friends , we saw an old lady all of a sudden drop her apples , I immediately went to the side walk and helped the lady , I picked up the apples and put them in a safe and clean bag . The old lady thanked me and told me , \"you're well mannered , thank you for your help , I appreciate it , may god bless you\" , I smiled and said \"your very welcome\" . The next day as I was going to the bus stop , to pick my little sister up from school , my little sister ran to me and said \"I sat next to this new girl in our school who was being bullied . I even shared my lunch with her because, she did not have much food at home to bring to school \" . I was delighted to hear her story , I told her why she did that , she responded \"when I saw you helping the old lady yesterday , I realized how nice you were and how happy the lady was , I decided to do something similar \" .\\n\\nThe third reason of how an act of kindness can benefit someone in many ways is , the good act of kindness can come back to you . For example , one day , a girl in our class came late to school , we were in our social studies class , she came and sat down and asked people if she could copy the notes , all of my classmates shouted \"NO\" .\\n\\nI went up to her and gave her my notes . She was happy and said thank you , when she finished copying my notes , I went to my seat . About a week later , we were having a contest in our school , whoever won would receive a prize . I sadly did not have any knowledge of the topic for the contest . The next day , I partnered up with the girl who copied my notes , I told her about how I wanted to win the contest . She looked happy and told me she knew all about the topic , she said she could help me and I replied with , \"I would appreciate it so much \" . I went to her house after school and taught me all about the animal , we needed to have certain knowledge of the animal to do the contest in our school . The next day , I did the project and the next day ,I winned .I thanked the girl .\\n\\nIn conclusion , any act of kindness can benefit a person , you might make them smile , make them learn , or , the act will come back to you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Many people are kind and do a part of helping others. What they don't know is how small or big. Yes, this person may have a better time because of your kindness. This person may learn things from your good deeds. Finally, good behavior can come back from the person you help. It may affect a person, the person you help may have a bad day, or you never know what someone is experiencing, and they may live a difficult life. For a bad day or life, your kindness may make the person feel much better and it is worth mentioning. A person is not always friendly, you may show a bright smile on their faces, or make them better a day. Those who are regarded as a good personality and manner If you are a kind person, please always rely on what you know. When I said .i, of course, I told her something wrong, and it sounded really happy. She told me that she had experienced many things at home. No one wanted to be her friend. It was difficult for me to hear it. I told her that she could be my friend. On the rest of the day, she smiled and smiled. If you take action, you can influence a person and generosity with your own behavior, and make good choices. Some people will learn from your words and actions.Like someone who is impolite and make a mistake, others will learn from your behavior. Many people tend to learn from people in the environment, especially young people. Therefore, if a young man sees your friendly behavior to help them or others, they can learn from your behavior and see you as a big big school For example, people should always make good decisions because young people can benefit from your choice, and will always look at you to make them live. They or others take good deeds, and young children will automatically learn from you. For example, my sister and I played with our friends in the park one day. We saw an old lady suddenly put down her apple. I immediately walked to the side and helped the lady. I picked up the apple. Put them in a safe and clean bag. The old lady thanked M E and told me: \"You have a good manner, thank you for your help, I thank you, I wish God bless you.\" I said with a smile, \"You are very welcome.\" The next day, when I went to the bus station, in order to pick up my sister from the school, my sister ran to me and said, \"I sit next to this new girl in the school. Take the school. Do a similar thing.\" Essence \"The third reason why kind behavior benefits in many ways is that good deeds can return to you. For example, one day, a girl in our class is late to school. We attended a social research class. She came down. Ask people if people can copy notes, all my classmates shouted \"no\".I went to find her and gave her my notes.She was very happy to say thank you. When she finished my notes, I sat on my seat.A week later, we participated in the competition in school. No matter who won, we will receive a prize.I do n’t know about the topic of the game.The next day, I cooperated with the girl who copied notes, and I told her how I wanted to win the game.She looked very happy and told me that she knew nothing about this topic. She said she could help me, and I replied, \"I thank it very much. Animals are playing in our school. The next day, I did it.This project, the next day, I won. I thank the girl. Conclusion, any good deeds can benefit one person. You may make them smile, make them smile, or this behavior will return to you.</td>\n",

And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. I believe that keeping our school's lunch menu is a good idea. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the school's lunch is way better than they think it is.\\n\\nMy initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some student's favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy.\\n\\nthey are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldn't be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money. the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. American's have this quote that \" if you have lemons make lemonades\" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it.\\n\\nIn additon, the current school's lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I haven't seen any student that has protested against the school's lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on it's own way. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods.\\n\\nAgain,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. I have been eating our school's green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive. So principal, dont you think that changing our school's cafeteria's lunch menu is a bad idea?\\n\\nFor instance, our school cafeteria's lunch has got protein,Vitamin D and my weight is intact, as far as our health is concerned, so take all of these reasons into consideration and figure out your final answer,I hope that you make the right choice for the school and l know that the school's improvement is your priority.\\n\\nThank you respectively,\\n\\nGeneric_Name 11th grade( junior)</td>\n",

As a junior student in this school, I think this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. Therefore, I decided to share my thoughts on the development and health of this school. I believe that retaining the school's lunch menu is a good idea. I know my opponents will argue with me because they may think that our students have eaten the same food for a long time, and they must have different versions of food, and explore their school lunch like other schools. However, when they find me the reason, they will determine that the school's lunch is better than they think.\\n\\nThe original reason I disagreed with this change is that it will eliminate some students' favorite cafeteria foods, especially me. At present, there are many foods in the buffet restaurant so beautiful, clean and healthy.\\n\\nThey are also enough for everyone to eat, so they do not need to change the menu, which will waste time and money. There are many things to focus on the school. The words of Americans are \"if you have lemon to make lemonade\", which means that we should play the greatest role through embrace it instead of changing it.\\n\\nIn Additon, the current school's lunch menu is very technically healthy. I think of this extraordinary idea, because I haven't seen any student protesting the school lunch, which means that the current school lunch is unique. Similarly, school lunch may be some amazing American cuisine.\\n\\nSimilarly, most American foods are garbage, making students gradually gain weight for a long time. But our current foods include fruits, vegetables and green salads to prevent the human body from gaining too much weight and bearing normal weight. I have eaten the green salad of the school for a while, and L saw some wonderful changes in my body, which left a deep impression. Therefore, do you think that the lunch menu of the school's buffet restaurant is a bad idea?\\n\\nFor example, the lunch in our school canteen has protein, vitamin D, and my weight is complete. As far as our health is concerned, please consider all these reasons and find out your final answer. I hope you make it correctly For schools, I know that the improvement of school is your primary task.\\n\\nThank you separately\\n\\nGeneric_name 11th grade (junior high school)</td>\n",

But one day, one of my close friends asked me why I didn't go to school, and I told him everything. He told me directly that he ignored all the negative things that people called me and lived your life enriched. From that day, we have been brothers. He always has my back, I always have him. A few weeks passed, and I told my mother. We talked for a few hours and discussed how I should ignore all negative things, because life is too short, you can't let anything stop you. That really changed me and how I think of life.\\n\\nIt is very difficult to try to be yourself in this world. Just telling someone to be ugly, you can really change the whole person. They started buying things they don't like. Do what they don't want to do. Suddenly they started doing bad things. Just to be with other people with all beautiful clothes and shoes, people really cannot become themselves because of judgment.\\n\\nThere should be more help in this world, so people who experience this process can get help. People should be inspired to become themselves or love themselves. Some people can really explain, and the victims can commit suicide, just because of someone's judgment. People should start respecting others. Parents should show their children as soon as possible to start teaching their children. People should not care about someone's opinions. People should live fully.\\n\\nPeople should become their own achievements in this world. People really make you feel garbage because they say negative words to you. There will always be negative things to come to you, which is normal. This is why you become stronger and turn you into a great person. That should inspire you to do great things in your life. This is the one who makes your Rave and everyone proud. Becoming Rave in this world should be the biggest achievement.</td>\n",

Students should definitely be involved in after school activities, whether if it's a sport or club, students will enjoy their time. Extracurricular activities could help a student get into collage. The student should be allowed to be apart of as many after school activities as they choose, they should first discusses with their families. The schools should not have the decision if students are in a activity or not based of if they will have time to do homework or study they should let the student make the decision and here's why.\\n\\nThe students should be allowed to be in as many activities as possible, while managing their time. The student will have to add the activity to their schedule, and know they will now be doing this on a daily basses or if not multiple times a week. The students family will be able to help the student out when in need of it. There will be time for homework and studying, because with a well put together schedule the student will go to school their choice of activity and go home and do their work. The student and their family should be in control of the management of school work and activities the school shouldnt be involved. When you know something works for you do not let anyone get in between what works for and what doesnt work. Students will have many opportunities in high school the extracurricular activities will just bring more and this is how.\\n\\nOpportunities come and go in high school, but when a student is in a after school activity they will lots of opportunities. Collage could be one of those opportunities, collages like to see a student that is or was apart of a club or sport team. Athletes can get full ride scholarships to collage, when they can manage to do their school work and the activities it could help them in the future. A student managing their time can be difficult but with a well put together schedule can help them get to where they want to be. This is why schools shouldnt control student involvement in extracurricular activities but many have their opinions against this one.\\n\\nOther say that the schools should have control over students and what activities the can do and however many they can do. The school wants the student to be able to have time to study and do homework but by doing that they will take away from the extracurricular activities students are in or want to be in. They say the school should have the power to be able to do this, the student and their families will not really have a say in the final decision. They say the school knows what is right for the student in making the decision on if they should be apart of a after school activity. The school wants the students to be able to do school work outside of school so they will want to take away from a club or sport so a student can have time to do the work.\\n\\nThe extracurricular activities should be in control of the students and their family, the school should not limit the amount of activities a student can do. The student should be in control in what they want to do if it's a cub or sport, they will have to make time to put this in their schedule and still have time to study and do homework. Doing this can help a student reach goals and they can enjoy their time while doing it. This is why the student should be in control of the activities they do.</td>\n",

Reasons an act of kindness can really benefit someone are , the person might have a better day just because of your kindness , the person might learn from your act of kindness and lastly , a good act of kindness can come back to you from the person who you helped .\\n\\nThe first reason of how kindness can impact a person is , the person whom you helped might have had a bad day or , you never know what someone is going through , they could have a hard life and are hiding it . The person who received the act of kindness might have bad a bad day or life , your kindness could have made that person feel so much better and worthy. Some people don't often receive kindness , you might have put a big smile on their face or , made their day much better . You can be seen as a person with good characters and manners , people can always depend on you if you are a kind person and do a lot to help make someone feel better with words or actions everyday , most people would appreciate you if you did almost anything to help them or make them smile because again , you never know what someone is going through . For example , I partnered up with a girl in our math class , she was crying for some reason and nobody wanted to be her partner , when I told her if she can be my partner , she said yes and sounded really happy when I said . I , of course told her what was wrong , she told me she was going through a lot at home and nobody wanted to be her friend in school , I was devastated to hear that . I told her she can be my friend and for the rest of the day she smiled and laughed .\\n\\nThe second reason any act of kindness , big or small , can impact a person is , the person receiving the kindness can learn from you and make themselves a better character too , you can influence a person with how you act , if you act kind and generous and , make good choices , someone is gonna learn from your words and actions . Same with if your a person who is just rude and makes bad decisions , someone else , will learn from your actions . Many people tend to learn from people in their environment , especially young people , so if a young person sees you offering a kind act of helping to either them or someone else , they can learn from your actions and see you as a big role model , people should always make good decisions for many reasons one being that young people can benefit from your choices and will always look up to you for being the person to guide them through life , many people make bad decisions around children but if you do an act of kindness , to them or someone else , young kids will automatically learn from you . For example , one day me and my little sister were in the park , playing with our friends , we saw an old lady all of a sudden drop her apples , I immediately went to the side walk and helped the lady , I picked up the apples and put them in a safe and clean bag . The old lady thanked me and told me , \"you're well mannered , thank you for your help , I appreciate it , may god bless you\" , I smiled and said \"your very welcome\" . The next day as I was going to the bus stop , to pick my little sister up from school , my little sister ran to me and said \"I sat next to this new girl in our school who was being bullied . I even shared my lunch with her because, she did not have much food at home to bring to school \" . I was delighted to hear her story , I told her why she did that , she responded \"when I saw you helping the old lady yesterday , I realized how nice you were and how happy the lady was , I decided to do something similar \" .\\n\\nThe third reason of how an act of kindness can benefit someone in many ways is , the good act of kindness can come back to you . For example , one day , a girl in our class came late to school , we were in our social studies class , she came and sat down and asked people if she could copy the notes , all of my classmates shouted \"NO\" .\\n\\nI went up to her and gave her my notes . She was happy and said thank you , when she finished copying my notes , I went to my seat . About a week later , we were having a contest in our school , whoever won would receive a prize . I sadly did not have any knowledge of the topic for the contest . The next day , I partnered up with the girl who copied my notes , I told her about how I wanted to win the contest . She looked happy and told me she knew all about the topic , she said she could help me and I replied with , \"I would appreciate it so much \" . I went to her house after school and taught me all about the animal , we needed to have certain knowledge of the animal to do the contest in our school . The next day , I did the project and the next day ,I winned .I thanked the girl .\\n\\nIn conclusion , any act of kindness can benefit a person , you might make them smile , make them learn , or , the act will come back to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     5.0     4.5         5.0          4.5      5.0          4.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  许多人是善良的，在帮助他人方面做的一部分，他们不知道的是，无论是多么小还是大。是，这个人可能仅仅因为您的善良而过得更好，这个人可能会从您的善举中学到东西，最后，善良的行为可以从您帮助的人那里回来。可能会影响一个人，您所帮助的人可能度过了糟糕的一天，或者，您永远不知道某人正在经历什么，他们可能会过着艰难的生活。糟糕的一天或生活，您的好意可能会让该人感觉好多了，值得一提。一个人不经常受到友善，您可能会在他们的脸上露出灿烂的笑容，或者使他们的一天变得更好。被视为具有良好性格和举止的人如果您是一个善良的人，请始终依靠您知道有人正在经历什么。当我说.i，当然告诉她出了什么问题时，听起来真的很高兴，她告诉我她在家经历了很多事情，没有人想成为她的朋友，我很难听到。我告诉她她可以成为我的朋友，在剩下的一天中，她微笑着笑了。如果您采取行动，您可以以自己的行为来影响一个人和慷慨，做出很好的选择，有人将从您的言语和行动中学习。与您的一个人不礼貌并做出错误决定的人一样，其他人会从您的行为中学到。许多人倾向于向环境中的人们，尤其是年轻人学习，因此，如果一个年轻人看到您提供友善的行为帮助他们或其他人，他们可以从您的行为中学习并将您视为一个大榜样，人们应该始终做出好的决定，原因是年轻人可以从您的选择中受益，并且会始终仰望您为了使他们度过生活，许多人在孩子周围做出错误的决定，但是如果您对他们或其他人采取善举，年幼的孩子会自动向您学习。例如，我和我的妹妹有一天在公园里，和我们的朋友一起玩耍，我们看到一位老太太突然放下了她的苹果，我立即走到旁边，帮助那位女士，我拿起苹果，把它们放在一个安全干净的袋子里。老太太感谢M e并告诉我：“你举止良好，谢谢你的帮助，我感谢你，愿上帝保佑你。”我笑着说：“你们非常欢迎”。第二天，我去公交车站时，为了从学校接我的妹妹，我的妹妹跑向我，说：“我坐在学校里的这个新女孩旁边。要带上学校。做类似的事情”。“善良行为如何在许多方面受益的第三个原因是，善良的善行可以回到你身边。例如，有一天，我们班上的一个女孩上学迟到，我们参加了社会研究课，她来坐下来，问人们是否可以复制笔记，我所有的同学都大喊“不”。我去找她，给了她我的笔记。她很高兴，说谢谢你，当她完成我的笔记时，我坐在我的座位上。一周后，我们在学校里参加了比赛，无论谁赢了，都会收到奖品。我可悲的是对比赛的话题不了解。第二天，我与复制笔记的女孩合作，我告诉她我想如何赢得比赛。她看上去很高兴，并告诉我我她对这个话题一无所知，她说她可以帮助我，我回答说：“我非常感谢它。动物在我们学校进行比赛。第二天，我做了这个项目，第二天，我赢得了。我感谢女孩。结论，任何善举都可以使一个人受益，您可能会让他们微笑，使他们微笑学习，或者，该行为将回到您身边。  Many people are kind and do a part of helping others. What they don't know is how small or big. Yes, this person may have a better time because of your kindness. This person may learn things from your good deeds. Finally, good behavior can come back from the person you help. It may affect a person, the person you help may have a bad day, or you never know what someone is experiencing, and they may live a difficult life. For a bad day or life, your kindness may make the person feel much better and it is worth mentioning. A person is not always friendly, you may show a bright smile on their faces, or make them better a day. Those who are regarded as a good personality and manner If you are a kind person, please always rely on what you know. When I said .i, of course, I told her something wrong, and it sounded really happy. She told me that she had experienced many things at home. No one wanted to be her friend. It was difficult for me to hear it. I told her that she could be my friend. On the rest of the day, she smiled and smiled. If you take action, you can influence a person and generosity with your own behavior, and make good choices. Some people will learn from your words and actions.Like someone who is impolite and make a mistake, others will learn from your behavior. Many people tend to learn from people in the environment, especially young people. Therefore, if a young man sees your friendly behavior to help them or others, they can learn from your behavior and see you as a big big school For example, people should always make good decisions because young people can benefit from your choice, and will always look at you to make them live. They or others take good deeds, and young children will automatically learn from you. For example, my sister and I played with our friends in the park one day. We saw an old lady suddenly put down her apple. I immediately walked to the side and helped the lady. I picked up the apple. Put them in a safe and clean bag. The old lady thanked M E and told me: \"You have a good manner, thank you for your help, I thank you, I wish God bless you.\" I said with a smile, \"You are very welcome.\" The next day, when I went to the bus station, in order to pick up my sister from the school, my sister ran to me and said, \"I sit next to this new girl in the school. Take the school. Do a similar thing.\" Essence \"The third reason why kind behavior benefits in many ways is that good deeds can return to you. For example, one day, a girl in our class is late to school. We attended a social research class. She came down. Ask people if people can copy notes, all my classmates shouted \"no\".I went to find her and gave her my notes.She was very happy to say thank you. When she finished my notes, I sat on my seat.A week later, we participated in the competition in school. No matter who won, we will receive a prize.I do n’t know about the topic of the game.The next day, I cooperated with the girl who copied notes, and I told her how I wanted to win the game.She looked very happy and told me that she knew nothing about this topic. She said she could help me, and I replied, \"I thank it very much. Animals are playing in our school. The next day, I did it.This project, the next day, I won. I thank the girl. Conclusion, any good deeds can benefit one person. You may make them smile, make them smile, or this behavior will return to you.

And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. I believe that keeping our school's lunch menu is a good idea. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the school's lunch is way better than they think it is.\\n\\nMy initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some student's favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy.\\n\\nthey are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldn't be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money. the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. American's have this quote that \" if you have lemons make lemonades\" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it.\\n\\nIn additon, the current school's lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I haven't seen any student that has protested against the school's lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on it's own way. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods.\\n\\nAgain,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. I have been eating our school's green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive. So principal, dont you think that changing our school's cafeteria's lunch menu is a bad idea?\\n\\nFor instance, our school cafeteria's lunch has got protein,Vitamin D and my weight is intact, as far as our health is concerned, so take all of these reasons into consideration and figure out your final answer,I hope that you make the right choice for the school and l know that the school's improvement is your priority.\\n\\nThank you respectively,\\n\\nGeneric_Name 11th grade( junior)                                                                                                                          4.5     5.0         5.0          4.5      5.0          4.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    亲爱的校长，\\n\\n我听说学校自助餐厅计划改为新的健康学校午餐的计划。作为这所学校的大三学生，我认为这个新的动态想法更改学校的午餐菜单是一个坏主意。因此，我决定分享我对这所学校的发展和健康的想法。我相信保留学校的午餐菜单是个好主意。我知道我的对手会与我争论，因为他们可能会认为我们的学生长时间吃了相同的食物，并且一定想拥有不同版本的食物，并像其他学校一样探索他们的学校午餐通常这样做。但是，当他们发现我的原因时，他们会确定学校的午餐比他们想象的要好。\\n\\n我不同意这一变化的最初原因是，它将消除一些学生最喜欢的食堂食品，尤其是我，目前在自助餐厅中有很多食物是如此美观，干净和健康。\\n\\n他们也足以让每个人都可以吃，因此不需要更改菜单，这将是浪费时间和金钱。学校有很多事情要专注。美国人的话是“如果您有柠檬制作柠檬水”，这意味着我们应该通过拥抱它而不是改变它来从我们拥有的一切中发挥最大的作用。\\n\\n在Additon中，当前学校的午餐菜单在技术上很健康，我想到了这个非凡的想法，因为我还没有看到任何学生抗议学校的午餐，这意味着当前的学校午餐是独一无二的。同样，学校午餐可能是一些令人惊叹的美国美食。\\n\\n同样，大多数美国食品都是垃圾，使学生长期逐渐增加体重。但是我们目前的食物包括水果，蔬菜和绿色沙拉，可防止人体增加体重过多并承受正常体重。我已经吃了学校的绿色沙拉一段时间了，L看到了我的身体一些奇妙的变化，这给人留下了深刻的印象。因此，校长，您不认为改变学校的自助餐厅的午餐菜单是个坏主意吗？\\n\\n例如，我们的学校食堂的午餐有蛋白质，维生素D，而且我的体重是完整的，就我们的健康状况而言，因此请考虑所有这些原因并找出您的最终答案，我希望您做出正确的选择对于学校而言，我知道学校的改善是您的首要任务。\\n\\n分别谢谢你\\n\\ngeneric_name 11年级（初中）                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Dear principal,\\n\\nI heard that the school's buffet restaurant plans to change to a new health school lunch. As a junior student in this school, I think this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. Therefore, I decided to share my thoughts on the development and health of this school. I believe that retaining the school's lunch menu is a good idea. I know my opponents will argue with me because they may think that our students have eaten the same food for a long time, and they must have different versions of food, and explore their school lunch like other schools. However, when they find me the reason, they will determine that the school's lunch is better than they think.\\n\\nThe original reason I disagreed with this change is that it will eliminate some students' favorite cafeteria foods, especially me. At present, there are many foods in the buffet restaurant so beautiful, clean and healthy.\\n\\nThey are also enough for everyone to eat, so they do not need to change the menu, which will waste time and money. There are many things to focus on the school. The words of Americans are \"if you have lemon to make lemonade\", which means that we should play the greatest role through embrace it instead of changing it.\\n\\nIn Additon, the current school's lunch menu is very technically healthy. I think of this extraordinary idea, because I haven't seen any student protesting the school lunch, which means that the current school lunch is unique. Similarly, school lunch may be some amazing American cuisine.\\n\\nSimilarly, most American foods are garbage, making students gradually gain weight for a long time. But our current foods include fruits, vegetables and green salads to prevent the human body from gaining too much weight and bearing normal weight. I have eaten the green salad of the school for a while, and L saw some wonderful changes in my body, which left a deep impression. Therefore, do you think that the lunch menu of the school's buffet restaurant is a bad idea?\\n\\nFor example, the lunch in our school canteen has protein, vitamin D, and my weight is complete. As far as our health is concerned, please consider all these reasons and find out your final answer. I hope you make it correctly For schools, I know that the improvement of school is your primary task.\\n\\nThank you separately\\n\\nGeneric_name 11th grade (junior high school)  [4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0, 4.0]      447   [3.457, 3.355, 3.582, 3.553, 3.531, 3.29]  1.249191\n",

When students attend classes from home, they will be able to manage their own sketchual, learn how to control their time efficiently, be more self-reliance, and prepare for the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is a benefit for students to attend classes from home, because they can learn how to make their own plan, and learn how to manage time, which I believe that it will help the students a lot in their jobs, future life goals or even their entire life.       4.0     4.5         4.5          4.5      4.5          4.5

作为自己的学生，我认为学生会从家里上课中受益，因为上课可以帮助学生管理自己的时间并学习如何自我控制，并可以遵循自己的学习速度。\\n\\n随着日复一日的流逝，我相信很多学生厌倦了重复同样的乏味的素描，并希望他们能在家里上学，另一方面，他们每天都不必那么早就醒来。他们的作业直到这么晚。当学生在家上课时，他们将能够管理自己的素描，学习如何有效地控制时间，更加自负并为未来做准备。\\n\\n总之，这对学生来说是一个好处目标甚至他们的一生。

can help students manage their time and learn how to control themselves, and can follow their own learning speed.\\n\\nWith the passage of day after day, I believe that many students are tired of repeating the same boring sketches and hope that they can go to school at home. On the other hand, they don't have to wake up so early every day.Their homework was so late.When students are at home, they will be able to manage their sketches, learn how to effectively control the time, be more arrogant and prepare for the future.\\n\\nIn short, this is a benefit for students and even their lives.

Advises or opinions would solve one's problem. For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\\n\\nFirst, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.\\n\\nFurthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\\n\\nFinally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. For instant, if someone gets confuse. If you're lost on one subject. Also, if someone gets lonely. if someone doesn't have a baseball team. Lastly, if someone gets worried or afraid. If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\\n\\nIn summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.       2.0     2.0         3.0          2.5      2.5          2.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                最终，每个人​​都会问一个建议，他们是否需要对特定主题的帮助，或者是否曾经感到困惑。建议或意见将解决一个人的问题。例如，为了防止做出错误的选择或决策，确定哪种建议是准确的，并让某人对选择感到安全。寻求多种意见可以帮助某人做出更好的选择。\\n\\n首先，寻求多种意见可以帮助某人通过防止做出错误的选择或决策来做出更好的选择。瞬间，如果有人试图偷窃。如果您想要一些东西，但这很昂贵。另外，如果有人打架。如果有您不喜欢或不同意的人。最后，如果有人撒谎。当有人做错事并撒谎时。寻求多种意见可以帮助某些人做出更好的选择。\\n\\n此外，寻求多种意见可以通过确定哪种建议准确地帮助人们做出更好的选择。例如，确保它是可靠的。如果许多人说同样的话，而其他人说了不同的话。另外，如果有人不确定建议。如果建议不准确，请询问更多建议。最后，如果建议不准确。如果有人说一件事而其他人说另一件事。寻求多种意见可以帮助某人做出更好的选择。\\n\\n最后，寻求多种意见可以通过让某人感到安全选择，从而帮助某人做出更好的选择。瞬间，如果有人感到困惑。如果您迷失了一个主题。另外，如果有人变得孤独。如果有人没有棒球队。最后，如果有人担心或害怕。如果您认识的人缺席或走了。寻求多种意见可以帮助某人做出更好的选择。\\n\\n总而言之，观看许多意见可以使人们受益，从而通过防止做出错误的选择或决策，确定哪些建议是准确的，并允许某人对选择的安全，从而使人们做出更好的选择。我相信问自己也是必要的。但是，观看人的许多意见可能比查看自己的建议更必要。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In the end, everyone will ask a suggestion whether they need to help specific themes, or whether they are confused. Suggestions or opinions will solve a person's problem. For example, in order to prevent wrong choices or decisions, it is accurate to determine which suggestion is to be safe. Seeking a variety of opinions can help someone make better choices.\\n\\nFirst of all, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices by preventing wrong choices or decisions. Instantly, if anyone tries to steal it. If you want something, but it's expensive. In addition, if anyone fights. If you don't like or disagree. Finally, if someone lie. When someone does something wrong and lie. Seeking multiple opinions can help some people make better choices.\\n\\nIn addition, seeking multiple opinions can accurately help people make better choices by determining which suggestions. For example, make sure it is reliable. If many people say the same, and others say differently. In addition, if someone is not sure of suggestions. If the suggestion is not accurate, please ask more suggestions. Finally, if the suggestion is not accurate. If someone says one thing and others say another. Seeking a variety of opinions can help someone make better choices.\\n\\nFinally, seeking a variety of opinions can help someone make better choices by making someone feel a safe choice. Instantly, if someone feels confused. If you lose a theme. In addition, if anyone becomes lonely. If anyone does not have a baseball team. Finally, if someone is worried or afraid. If the person you know is absent or leave. Seeking a variety of opinions can help someone make better choices.\\n\\nAll in all, watching many opinions can benefit people, so as to prevent wrong selection or decision -making, determine which suggestions are accurate and allow someone to make people make better choices. I believe it is necessary to ask myself. However, many viewers' opinions may be more necessary than viewing their suggestions.

You want to always show the real you. That is the beuty of life,connecting with different types of people with different types of personalitys. People in this world now a days are cruel and mean that have no heart. People bully others because of theres clothes,shoes, and how they look. You can get bullied for anything now a days, its very sad. That's why people who get bullied hate themselves and want to become something they are not.\\n\\nI remember one point in my life, i was deppressed. I kept getting bullied because of how big my head was or how skinny i was. I know it sounds funny, i laugh all the time when i talk about it dont worry. I stopped wanting to come to school because of that. I never wanted to leave my house or talk to anyone. It was very sad. But one day one of my close friends asked me why i wasn't coming to school, and i told him everything. He told me straight up to ignore all the negative stuff that people call me and live your life to the fullest. Since that day, we have been bros for life. He always had my back and i always had his. A few weeks passed and i told my mother. We talked for a few hours about how i should ignore all the negative stuff because life is so short that you can't let anything stop you. That really changed me and how i see life.\\n\\nTrying to be yourself in this world is very difficult now a days. Just by telling someone that there shoes are ugly can really change the whole person. They start buying stuff that they don't really like. Also doing stuff they don't want to do. Suddenly they start doing bad stuff. Just to fit in with other people that have all the nice clothes and shoes etc. People really can't be themselves because of judgment.\\n\\nThere should be more help in this world so people that are going through this can get help. People should be motivated to be themselves and also love themselves. Some people can really say somethig mean and the victim could commite suicide, just because of someones judgment. People should start treating other people with respect. Parents should start teaching there kids early on how to show respect. People shouldn't care about someone elses opinion. People should live there lifes to the fullest.\\n\\nPeople should feel very accomplished to be themselves in this world. People really make you feel like trash when they say something negative about you. There is always going to be negative stuff coming at you, that's normal. That is what makes you stronger and turns you into a great human being. That is what should motivate you to do great things in life. That is what should make yourslef and everybody close to you proud. To be yourslef in this world should be the greatest accomplishment.       4.5     4.0         5.0          5.0      4.5          4.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           我同意艾默生的陈述，因为无论如何人们都应该成为自己。您想始终展示真实的您。这就是生活的态度，与具有不同类型个性的不同类型的人建立联系。现在，这个世界上的人们是残酷的，意味着没有心。人们因为有衣服，鞋子以及外观而欺负别人。现在，您可能会欺负任何事情，这非常可悲。这就是为什么被欺负的人讨厌自己并想成为自己不是的东西的原因。\\n\\n我记得我一生中的一点点，我被倒置了。我一直被欺负，因为我的头有多大或有多瘦。我知道这听起来很有趣，当我谈论它时，我一直都在笑。因此，我不再想上学。我从不想离开我的房子或与任何人交谈。这很可悲。但是有一天，我的一个密友问我为什么不上学，我告诉了他一切。他直接告诉我，忽略了人们称呼我的所有负面事情，并充实地过着您的生活。从那天开始，我们一直是兄弟。他总是有我的背，我总是有他的。几个星期过去了，我告诉母亲。我们谈论了几个小时，讨论了我应该如何忽略所有负面的东西，因为生活太短了，您不能让任何事情阻止您。那真的改变了我以及我如何看待生活。\\n\\n现在，在这个世界上尝试做自己非常困难。只是告诉某人那里的鞋子很丑陋，就可以真正改变整个人。他们开始购买自己不喜欢的东西。也做他们不想做的事情。突然他们开始做坏事。只是为了与其他拥有所有漂亮的衣服和鞋子等的人一起，人们真的不能因为判断而成为自己。\\n\\n这个世界上应该有更多的帮助，因此经历这一过程的人可以获得帮助。人们应该被激励自己成为自己，也应该爱自己。有些人真的可以说明白了，而受害者可以自杀，只是因为某人的判断。人们应该开始尊重他人。父母应该早点就如何表现尊重开始那里教孩子。人们不应该关心某人的意见。人们应该充实地生活。\\n\\n人们应该在这个世界上成为自己的成就。人们真的会让您感到垃圾，因为他们对您说负面的话。总会有负面的东西来到你身上，这是正常的。这就是使您变得更强壮的原因，并将您变成一个伟大的人。那应该激励您在生活中做伟大的事情。这就是让你的莱夫和每个人都骄傲的人。成为这个世界上的莱夫应该是最大的成就。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I agree with Emerson's statement, because people should be themselves anyway. You want to show you the real you. This is the attitude of life, establishing contact with people with different types of personality. Now, people in this world are cruel and mean no ingenuity. People bully others because they have clothes, shoes and appearance. Now you may bully anything, which is very sad. This is why the bullied person hates himself and wants to be something he is not.\\n\\nI remember a little bit in my life, and I was inverted. I have been bullied because my head is big or thin. I know it sounds interesting. When I talk about it, I have been laughing. Therefore, I no longer want to go to school. I never want to leave my house or talk to anyone. This is sad. But one day, one of my close friends asked me why I didn't go to school, and I told him everything. He told me directly that he ignored all the negative things that people called me and lived your life enriched. From that day, we have been brothers. He always has my back, I always have him. A few weeks passed, and I told my mother. We talked for a few hours and discussed how I should ignore all negative things, because life is too short, you can't let anything stop you. That really changed me and how I think of life.\\n\\nIt is very difficult to try to be yourself in this world. Just telling someone to be ugly, you can really change the whole person. They started buying things they don't like. Do what they don't want to do. Suddenly they started doing bad things. Just to be with other people with all beautiful clothes and shoes, people really cannot become themselves because of judgment.\\n\\nThere should be more help in this world, so people who experience this process can get help. People should be inspired to become themselves or love themselves. Some people can really explain, and the victims can commit suicide, just because of someone's judgment. People should start respecting others. Parents should show their children as soon as possible to start teaching their children. People should not care about someone's opinions. People should live fully.\\n\\nPeople should become their own achievements in this world. People really make you feel garbage because they say negative words to you. There will always be negative things to come to you, which is normal. This is why you become stronger and turn you into a great person. That should inspire you to do great things in your life.

Students should definitely be involved in after school activities, whether if it's a sport or club, students will enjoy their time. Extracurricular activities could help a student get into collage. The student should be allowed to be apart of as many after school activities as they choose, they should first discusses with their families. The schools should not have the decision if students are in a activity or not based of if they will have time to do homework or study they should let the student make the decision and here's why.\\n\\nThe students should be allowed to be in as many activities as possible, while managing their time. The student will have to add the activity to their schedule, and know they will now be doing this on a daily basses or if not multiple times a week. The students family will be able to help the student out when in need of it. There will be time for homework and studying, because with a well put together schedule the student will go to school their choice of activity and go home and do their work. The student and their family should be in control of the management of school work and activities the school shouldnt be involved. When you know something works for you do not let anyone get in between what works for and what doesnt work. Students will have many opportunities in high school the extracurricular activities will just bring more and this is how.\\n\\nOpportunities come and go in high school, but when a student is in a after school activity they will lots of opportunities. Collage could be one of those opportunities, collages like to see a student that is or was apart of a club or sport team. Athletes can get full ride scholarships to collage, when they can manage to do their school work and the activities it could help them in the future. A student managing their time can be difficult but with a well put together schedule can help them get to where they want to be. This is why schools shouldnt control student involvement in extracurricular activities but many have their opinions against this one.\\n\\nOther say that the schools should have control over students and what activities the can do and however many they can do. The school wants the student to be able to have time to study and do homework but by doing that they will take away from the extracurricular activities students are in or want to be in. They say the school should have the power to be able to do this, the student and their families will not really have a say in the final decision. They say the school knows what is right for the student in making the decision on if they should be apart of a after school activity. The school wants the students to be able to do school work outside of school so they will want to take away from a club or sport so a student can have time to do the work.\\n\\nThe extracurricular activities should be in control of the students and their family, the school should not limit the amount of activities a student can do. The student should be in control in what they want to do if it's a cub or sport, they will have to make time to put this in their schedule and still have time to study and do homework. Doing this can help a student reach goals and they can enjoy their time while doing it. This is why the student should be in control of the activities they do.                2.5     2.5         3.0          2.5      2.5          2.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        尽管有人说课外活动是为了丰富许多人的教育经验。许多人说，应该肯定会参与课后活动，无论是运动还是俱乐部，学生都会享受时间。课外活动可以帮助学生进入拼贴画。应该允许他们选择在放学后尽可能多地与家人讨论。研究他们应该让学生做出决定，这就是为什么。应该允许学生参加尽可能多的活动，同时管理时间。每天的贝斯或每周多次进行此操作。学生家庭将能够在需要时帮助学生。 ，因为有一个很好的安排时间表，学生将上学他们选择的活动，然后回家并完成工作。学生及其家人应该控制学校工作和活动的管理。当您知道某事为自己有用时，不要让任何人参与其中的工作和不起作用的东西。学生将有很多机会在高中时，课外活动将带来更多，这就是如何出现在高中时，但是当学生参加课后活动时，他们将有很多机会。婚姻可能是这些机会之一，喜欢拼贴。看到一个或与俱乐部或运动团队分开的学生。运动员可以获得完整的骑行奖学金，何时可以设法完成他们的学校工作以及将来可以帮助他们的活动。管理时间的学生可以要困难，但是有一个很好的时间表可以帮助他们到达想要的地方。这就是为什么学校不应该控制学生参与课外活动的原因，但许多人再次发表意见这是一个。学校希望学生能够有时间学习和做功课，但是通过这样做，他们将摆脱学生所在或想参加的课外活动。他们说学校应该有权能够做到这，学生及其家人在最终决定中不会真正有发言权。他们说学校知道学生在决定是否应该分开的学生中是正确的。学校希望学生学生能够在学校外完成学校工作，以便他们想离开俱乐部或运动，以便学生有时间去做工作。课外活动应该控制学生及其家人，学校应该应该不要限制学生可以做的活动数量。学生应该控制自己想做的事情，如果是幼崽或运动，他们将不得不花时间将其付诸实践，并且仍然有时间学习和做作业。这可以帮助螺柱ENT达到目标，他们可以在做这件事的同时享受时间。这就是为什么学生应该控制自己的活动的原因。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Although some people say that extracurricular activities are to enrich the educational experience of many people.Many people say that they should definitely participate in after -class activities.

This is how to appear in high school, but when students participate in after -school activities, they will have many opportunities.Marriage may be one of these opportunities and likes collage.See a student who is separated from the club or sports team.Athletes can get a complete cycling scholarship, when they can try to complete their school work and activities that can help them in the future.Students who manage time can be difficult, but there is a good timetable to help them reach the place they want.This is why the school should not control students to participate in extracurricular activities, but many people again express their opinions.The school hopes that students can have time to learn and do their homework, but by doing so, they will get rid of the extra -curricular activities where the students are or want to participate.They said that the school should have the right to do this, and students and their families will not really have a speech in the final decision.They said that the school knew that students were correct among students who decided to separate.The school hopes that students can complete school work outside the school so that they want to leave the club or exercise so that students have time to do work.Extra -school activities should control students and their families.

It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to avoid worries and negative thinking. If you adopt it as a way of your life, it would bring constructive changes into your life, and makes them happier, brighter and more succesful.\\n\\nWhith a positive attitude you see the bring side of life, become optimistic and expect the best to happen. It is certainly a state of mind that is well worth developing.\\n\\nAlso a positive attitude leads to happiness and sucess and can change your whole life. If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light. This light affects not only you and the way you look at the world, but it also affects your enviroment and the people around you.\\n\\nIf this attitude is strong enough, it becomes contagious. I'ts as if you radiate light around you.\\n\\nWhen you are positive, you tend to pull yourself out of negative loop and don't lose focus from what you really want to achieve, the person with a positive attitude has a better perspective of life. understand that is important to take resposibility for one's actions for example: problems in your work, family, school etc. A strong sence of responsibility always envokes positive and constructive actions. A positive thinker is never impulsive, they always wait to get clarity of a particular situation.\\n\\nBeing positive and calm always enable you to see both sides of the coin.\\n\\nPositive attitude is the key to sucess in lifen because if you are positive you will belive and trust yourself, and you won't let negative people affect your deams, if not you will work hard until you get them and go will sucessful.                                                                               4.0     4.5         5.0          5.0      5.0          4.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        我同意这一说法，因为积极的态度可以帮助您更轻松地应对生活的日常事务。它使您的生活变得乐观，并使避免担心和负面思维变得更加容易。如果您采用它作为您的生活方式，它将为您的生活带来建设性的改变，并使它们更快乐，更明亮，更加成功。\\n\\n在您看到生活中的积极态度，变得乐观并期望最好的事情发生。当然，这是一种值得发展的心态。\\n\\n积极的态度也会带来幸福和成功，并可以改变您的一生。如果您看着生活的光明一面，您的一生都会充满光明。这种光不仅会影响您和您看待世界的方式，而且还会影响您的环境和周围的人。\\n\\n如果这种态度足够强烈，它就会具有感染力。我仿佛你散发着周围的光。\\n\\n当您的积极态度时，您倾向于摆脱负面循环，不要从真正想要实现的目标中失去专注力，具有积极态度的人对生活有了更好的看法。理解对自己的行为的呼吸性很重要：您的工作，家庭，学校的问题等。强大的责任总是环保积极和建设性的行动。积极的思想家永远不会冲动，他们总是等待清楚特定情况。\\n\\n积极和镇定总是使您能够看到硬币的两面。\\n\\n积极的态度是成功生命的关键，因为如果您是积极的，您将相信并相信自己，并且您不会让消极的人会影响您的脱口机，如果不是，您将努力工作，直到您得到他们并走开，就会成功。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I agree with this statement, because a positive attitude can help you cope with daily affairs of life easier.

If not, you will work hard until you get them until you get them. If you walk away, you will succeed.  [4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0]      305   [3.55, 3.521, 3.633, 3.678, 3.629, 3.244]  1.097581"
