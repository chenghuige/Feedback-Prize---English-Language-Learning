  """ Greedy decoder function for a sequence-to-sequence model used in the
  `dynamic_rnn_decoder`.

  The `greedy_decoder_fn_inference` is a greedy inference function for a
  sequence-to-sequence model. It should be used when `dynamic_rnn_decoder` is
  in the inference mode.

  The `greedy_decoder_fn_inference` is called with a set of the user arguments
  and returns the `decoder_fn`, which can be passed to the
  `dynamic_rnn_decoder`, such that

  ```
  dynamic_fn_inference = greedy_decoder_fn_inference(...)
  outputs_inference, state_inference = dynamic_rnn_decoder(
      decoder_fn=dynamic_fn_inference, ...)
  ```

  Further usage can be found in the `kernel_tests/seq2seq_test.py`.

  Args:
    output_fn: An output function to project your `cell_output` onto class
    logits.

    An example of an output function;

    ```
      tf.variable_scope("decoder") as varscope
        output_fn = lambda x: layers.linear(x, num_decoder_symbols,
                                            scope=varscope)

        outputs_train, state_train = seq2seq.dynamic_rnn_decoder(...)
        logits_train = output_fn(outputs_train)

        varscope.reuse_variables()
        logits_inference, state_inference = seq2seq.dynamic_rnn_decoder(
            output_fn=output_fn, ...)
    ```

    If `None` is supplied it will act as an identity function, which
    might be wanted when using the RNNCell `OutputProjectionWrapper`.

    encoder_state: The encoded state to initialize the `dynamic_rnn_decoder`.
    embeddings: The embeddings matrix used for the decoder sized
    `[num_decoder_symbols, embedding_size]`.
    start_of_sequence_id: The start of sequence ID in the decoder embeddings.
    end_of_sequence_id: The end of sequence ID in the decoder embeddings.
    maximum_length: The maximum allowed of time steps to decode.
    num_decoder_symbols: The number of classes to decode at each time step.
    dtype: (default: `dtypes.int32`) The default data type to use when
    handling integer objects.
    name: (default: `None`) NameScope for the decoder function;
      defaults to "greedy_decoder_fn_inference"

  Returns:
    A decoder function with the required interface of `dynamic_rnn_decoder`
    intended for inference.

    """ Decoder function used in the `dynamic_rnn_decoder` with the purpose of
    inference.

    The main difference between this decoder function and the `decoder_fn` in
    `greedy_decoder_fn_train` is how `next_cell_input` is calculated. In this
    decoder function we calculate the next input by applying an argmax across
    the feature dimension of the output from the decoder. This is a
    greedy-search approach. (Bahdanau et al., 2014) & (Sutskever et al., 2014)
    use beam-search instead.

    Args:
      time: positive integer constant reflecting the current timestep.
      cell_state: state of RNNCell.
      cell_input: input provided by `dynamic_rnn_decoder`.
      cell_output: output of RNNCell.
      context_state: context state provided by `dynamic_rnn_decoder`.

    Returns:
      A tuple (done, next state, next input, emit output, next context state)
      where:

      done: A boolean vector to indicate which sentences has reached a
      `end_of_sequence_id`. This is used for early stopping by the
      `dynamic_rnn_decoder`. When `time>=maximum_length` a boolean vector with
      all elements as `true` is returned.

      next state: `cell_state`, this decoder function does not modify the
      given state.

      next input: The embedding from argmax of the `cell_output` is used as
      `next_input`.

      emit output: If `output_fn is None` the supplied `cell_output` is
      returned, else the `output_fn` is used to update the `cell_output`
      before calculating `next_input` and returning `cell_output`.

      next context state: `context_state`, this decoder function does not
      modify the given context state. The context state could be modified when
      applying e.g. beam search.
