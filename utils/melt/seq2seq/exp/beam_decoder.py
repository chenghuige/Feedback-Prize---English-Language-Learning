"""
NOTICE this is ingraph beam decode as opposed to melt.seq2seq.beam_search which is ougraph beam search
but here also not dynamic, just use loop, do all max_steps until stop, for beam search 
actually you can not early stop also since more steps results might be better. 
if length normalizer == 0. then start from same state longer path could not be better.
so you might look at partial result if it not better then all the done beam then mark it as done TODO
but if length normalizer > 0 then.. you can not early stop by theory..
